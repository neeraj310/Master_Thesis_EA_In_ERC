The entire amount? Or only the amount I actually pay as rent
The entire amount less tax
Ok. Thanks :)
Can you give me an idea about how much was the amount
Offer letter says 2500
You might get around 1500
1000$ taxes? 
There will be lot of tax on bonus and stuff
Yeah 
We were given amount_1 for relocation I got around amount_2
They are not even giving me relocation 
Ya that's the amount for rent and relocation
Oh. Ok..

Yeah absolutely
You won't need to produce any receipts. At least I didn't have to
person_81~~

Also, I desperately want that corrin person_7 fic to continue. 
LMFAO yeah?
I've gotten a few comments on it saying the same thing, so maybe
YES. I called it from the beginning ahaha. So like, I'm thinking of all the humor that can follow. 
Like awkward, shy person_7. 
you called it? hahaha
well if you tell me what you'd like to see, maybe that'd give me some inspiration ;3
Lolll I hope so! The bet ends in Dec and whoever loses buys the winner groceries for the week hehe

Got in a few hours ago, just relaxing at this point

I'm uploading the album now though; it's just taking a while
Uploading?
Yeah, I'm putting it on Dropbox then giving you a link
thx mang
i really appreciate that
Have you done 4a for 301?
Im doing Q1 rn lol
Damn
< 4 hours to complete
Are you on campus working on it?
Yeah
It really isnt
I was talking to person_79
The convolution take awhile but if you know whats up its okay
I'm just confused on how to convolve Delta functions
I can't seem to find any good examples
Anything convolved with delta is the function
So x(t) * d(t) = x(t)
Wait really?
Okay
Yeah
even with any offset to d(t)
like d(t-2)
oh wait i got it now
Well if the delta function has an offset its still an impulse lol
It just shifts the function to the location of the impulse
Well yeah but thats just like a normal time shift
person_10
I'm getting my midterm back for a class tomorrow and I know the paper will get me a score_1
Fair. 
What's your fc again,
FC?
Oh, you can look it up in here
Hm?
I lost it; it was so long ago
You can search through messages
person_11
Are you still at person_12's? 
Hey beeb
I am!
What are you up to?
Just trying to get my documents together asap
And then get to bed 
Bc I'm meeting person_13 at forest hills  at like 8 am
Oh heck
I guess I'm going to be getting to bed later than you
I hope the test goes well though!
How do you feel about it?
Bub?
idk gonna wing it?
i'll probably be fine
i remember last time it was very easy
Oh good
I hope so my dude
yeah
the only thing is that like.... i'm so tired
what are you up to at ben's?
just you and him?
Nah, he, me, alys, ben, and person_8 are playing cards against humanity
You should get some sleep if you're tired though
I mean you usually get 5-6 of every RRR we cant make them pay for that then jip them lol
I know, that's why I'm saying if they buy their shit then they're getting what they paid for, and then I'll have to get the singles I want from the new set.
G set 8 drops in 2 months
So we have time to set up a split
Machining won...
So... uhhh
wait organization_0 won location_0?
Yeah
It was playing Machining A
I dont even know what the hell it does
Uh do you meant Machining Ant?
*mean
The garbo grade zero
person_14
Time for you to build Machining amirite?
No fuck no, deck sucks
He double critted mason games 1 and 2
But it won an event so that means it's meta, right? [:
There is legit reason if that was the case to believe he may have stacked
person_15 was 3 of 8 tho in ATL
(Deck is still shit)
Better, but still bad
person_16, is person_17 ignoring me also sorry about the sales thing I got really busy with my trip and school starting back up
It's cool. I understand. But about tu, i have no idea
Do you still need it sold?
Yea i do lol
What was all of it?
Ill make a sales post
Just the vert now. Sold the location_1 already and im probably going to keep raindear sp
Sell the person_18 and the person_96 too?
I have a buyer for organization_13, and im keeping lauris now
Probably gunna look fir the scr cause is so cheap lol
person_19
Lol
Can you give me a time stamp with my name on it :D
With the vert
So I can make a post
I can later tomorrow, super burnt out tonight
State fair is crazy up hate
Here
Kk ill upload it when you send the pic
Ohhh damn
Not in the past week but I know a likely reason. Did you put in all the info, hit render in qube, then get no feedback?
Correct. There isnt a tab to submit the user account name nor the prompt to enter a password
You're going to need the ITaP installer of qube which I can get for you and then your organization_1 credentials to be added to this database
I know the name of the database but have no idea the red tape or who has the authority to determine that
That would be fantastic. Who do you think I should contact?
I haven't been told very much about the deal with that, I just rest it when they asked me
Test
Understandable
Haha well I know the guy who built it but don't know who manages it. You might ask person_20 or person_21 about who has that list
I think last I knew about it they were deciding which students to put on it, like ones in labs or certain classes but still no one here at organization_2 has it either besides me and person_22
Will ask person_21 tomorrow. I'm just thoroughly frustrated and wanting to push boundaries and not wait for my renders haha. Appreciate the knowledge, hopefully I can get them to budge and get person_23 to get them moving.
Main reason I'm testing is because person_89 has 40 students in the Intro to FX class this semester and he released the doc to render to the farm :)
lol
going for jn concert later?
Unlikely ):
If I go for it I'll have to skip church
oh
cos you not in church now?
yea
in etc
doing work
so much work
eh yeah same here ><
anw, I'll be praying for you/your housemate/your family
stay strong :)
thank you!
lol my housemates actually just made me realllllyyyy annoyed this morning
i told them i had to be in school by 945 today and they said they could fetch me
then in the middle of the night after i went to sleep they decided they dont want to fetch me anymore
which im totally fine with, as long as they tell me in advance so i can wake up earlier cos driving to etc take 10min but public transport takes >30min and is dependent on the buses which dont come often on weekend
so involved
geagle sucks
its small
are you going to explain you uncle why i am good for you
i don't even know my uncle
i'm crying
the guy in the center is freshman on our badminton team

person_28
Like a bean
More proof person_86 is bean
Yes exactly
His hands always just smack it down to the ground though

I can't wait to have more group shit over the summer 
Are you gonna be in location_3 for most of it? 
Not likely; I'm gonna be back in town for the first bit, but I'm gonna be in location_4 in some capacity for the majority
Fug 
Well I'm sure it will be a great time nonetheless 
heh no choice la
i also wanna sleep tonight

ehh i ask you
haha ok pls sleep
do you follow/watch any sports?
haha not really
but i used to play a lot of sports though
i dont watch anything haha
never had the habit of watching tv
or youtube even
lewis acid base
Oh dang
I may need to ask person_29
What's your take
So is B(OH) 4-
A Lewis acid base?
Reaction
yeah
maybe the borax one isn't one
so I think there are two possibilities: 1. the borax is wrong
2. they only wanted one of the two possible products for the other reaction
I still need ota room ;;
Word same

Btw since you want person_32, the GR market price is 34. Wanna get me an organization_12 which is 24 and we can work out the 10 bucks
Btw I suggest trading at market price, they fixed the algorithms so it works now
Ill put tthat on my wants when I put my trade post up

Kk
But really trade at market so you dont get wrecked by hype

"You're rude"
i'm sorry
He's an ass I can't wait to go back to pgh
I love you
Try not to let it get to you
Talk less with him until he's in a less snippy mood
We're in a car together
There's not much avoiding I can do
Yeah
Try to be a little quieter than normal without being cold or unusual, if you can
Legit summer could be a week long if it weren't for you
Engage less without being obvious about it I guess
I love you
Sorry to give hard advice
He's so mean
To everyone
I hate it
:/
I miss you
Ohhh
cool! nice nice
Till then I'm looking into what else can I do
perfect!
I'm also thinking of going and attending classes
went to the ri picnic? you should obv do that
is it very hard to get permission?
Classes have started this monday
Depends on the prodessor
And there s less space in some of the courses
ohhh okay
Because there are people from across departments who want to sit
the highly preferred ones
hmmm
In one of the courses I saw, people had to sit on the floor
Because there was no space
Class full and it got hot so prof opened the doors
woh man
Like 150 people
wohh nice nice
Did you upload
Trying buty internet keeps dropping. person_41 sent an email saying we'd see spots

PLURAL DOGS NAMED SPOT
Hahahaha spots of dropped service
I wish dogs would come out of my computer.
can we talk about how airbud made multiple films
And how it apparently continues to make money.
ngl I'd buy
Can we make something like corgiorgy.com?
oh god
That was my home site for over a year.
you savage
Literally opened it up in the front row of a 150 person lecture. Welcome to hell you motherfuckers
omg lol

anyone got into the finals?
i  dunno what it's called
<{
gone to the real party
lol
No Fringe D didn't qualify, Fringe C did though
And SigNu doesn't ever practice lol, so the fact that they did as well as they did was surprisingly 
*surprising
ohh wow
wt abt fringe A and B
Lol that goes without saying
so out of the 8 teams fringe got  3?
Oh no it hasn't been narrowed down that much yet
 WAIT FOR ME
I'M OTW TO THE BUS STOP

Ok nvm there's some drama between freshmen
And i was wondering 
Lol what 
Is person_103 giving you the insights
They talking 
And I'm listening 
Isn't it you and organization_5 and person_85 and her
Yeah
organization_5 person_103 were talking
O so organization_5 and her gossip 
What's this gossip 
person_47
Later 
Okay 
Are person_104 and person_105 ya a thing
so, the slope of Ln(v) vs. Ln(m) is b?
the slope of ln(v) vs ln(m) is 1/n
ah ok
slope = 1/n
yeah
I'll try to answer the other analysis questions
and so then we can plug that into our equation for C and find b
i don't think we need to do the other questions
i'm not sure
but I don't think everyone had those done
yeah these questions are also confusing
I know he said he wanted values for b and n
They tell you to graph v vs mass twice
yeah
not great
i think they assume that the first graphs are by hand or something
yeah
alright, should I email person_95, or drop off a printed copy tomorrow?
uhhh i said i would play kickball if i dont go to tennis
why
person_88 i is performing @ opem mic night but nvm i think shes cancelling

Yeah I went with person_54 last year 
Its so hard I am not fit enough 
Yeah agreed; I really miss that element in the new osts
Like the cliff jumping one on eudora becomes freaking amazing
Yeahhhh I love that one
It would've been cool for Eudora to be in the remake
And blarg station is great too for the same reason
Yeah I love eudora 
Blarg station's soundtrack in the remake had a lot of the same sounds as the original though
In fact, a lot of the planets' background tracks did
Yeah? I didn't listen too closely for that
Yeah, it was subtle, but it was there
A lot of the same instrumentation
Oh OK
So to speak, at least
Since the original was midi
Yeah
OK quartu has little jazz Honky tonk undertones that I never noticed before
Really?
Yeah its great
It's only later on in the song but its fantastic
I oughta give it another listen then
Go for i

theyre friends with both of us and sat with us during banquet
lmfao

and called it
thats why person_94 said we're so lucky we dont ahve to do anything
they just flock to us
lol

Lol
I don't think it matters, me and location_9 were talking about it on the way home
don't tell him tho
I wouldn't
cool
Hey are you still there?  I'm a little worried about you
yeah, sorry, i'm good. /n/nyeah, I am in choir, been in choir for all four years of high school and it's been a lot of fun. hard work, but i love it
what have you been up to?
ok/nnot much.  We did a big performance of person_67 the other week (I joined choir last year and really liked it)
that's really awesome :) i'm sure it was great!
yeah it was a lot of fun
it was this big collab between us and person_100 and person_101
oh wow, that's pretty amazing
idk if I could ever deal with three conductors at once again though
it was hectic
i guess they weren't literally conducting at the same time (they switched off between movements)
haha yeah i feel that. I did that in intermediate choir where half the class was conducted by one conductor and the rest with another director
(y)
somehow i've still got music to memorize this weekend
like, the year's almost over
i'm so ready to be done
haha yeah same here, i've got a few last minute gigs before i graduate
Lol
U staying for pep rally
All the rally's suck
The only good thing is getting out early
Yea but u could talk to u French fries
Guy
Ohlhaut?
I dont have the book lol
You can probably still say hi
And to ur other teachers u liked
Tru

Our seats aren't in the sun at time_1
But we got there at time_1 to get bobble heads
And at time_2 THEYRE in direct sunlight
poor thing
I look so scary omg

Going to now
person_40 just got out of the bathroom
I dropped her a message. Will be able to find her earlier. 
Will find her between 130-2
You can message her too. She didn't get back to me
Er I don't think she's free then
person_70
Apparently she has some lunch plans lol
What is the earliest. Cause my church service ends at time_1 lol
Dunno that one need to ask her
I thought you had other plans in between?
Yeah but I cleared it yesterday
Wanted to minimise the back and fro
Oh man
Anyw I msg her alr
Will le t you know when she replies!
Thanks man
Sry for the trouble ):
textbooks are expensive
i should probably make a list of stuff I need to pirate so that I can start looking now
person_113 pls
Don't buy any textbooks
yeah
so much money
also i'd rather carry my laptop than a textbook
I can borrow them from th organization_8 library too
mhm
For 2hrs at a time
they talked about kids coming in, borrowing for 2h at a time, and photocopying the whole thing
so bad
You're probably not gonna need them for class anyways. Just hw
yeah
a) i want to use my robo photo instead
b) what quote should i put?
i'm gonna find the robo photo
good
wow it's 1 already
jeez
i'm behind
person_71
Uhhhh
14?
That's what I got
But person_72 told me it's 13
In my middle term, he doesn't have w
It's just xz'
You sure the second one is 13
That's what he said
And I confirmed with another lad
Why?
How did you get the +4
3 is for the output of the 3 or gates and one for the final nand gate
Ohhh final
Then yeah if the w' doesnt exist its 13
But I don't know why he didn't include the w
Because you're wrapping from bottom right corner to top right corner and that includes x z and w
ya just chill and not take course if u dont need to
yeah, it's all good

Among several other reasons, consider this paraphrasing: "Hey, it's late July, and only a week or less ago we admitted person_74 to the program. He's flying out to set up a lease right now, and despite him having experience and classes in person_75, C++, and Statistics, let's change his admission status from unconditional to conditional, requiring that he take two "bridge classes", intro to python and intro to statistics, or else he can't continue in the program. But further, let's do that to all but one of the entering class as well, and schedule those classes all day on 4 Saturdays, starting more than 2 weeks before classes start, and we won't announce all this until a little more than a week before the first of those classes starts. (date_1). Let's also make attendance and passage mandatory, or they will be dropped from the program. I'm sure students across the country can relocate within a week's time to location_10... Also, let's keep admitting students until date_2, or even later, and with the same requirements, I'm sure it won't be an absolute logistical nightmare.
"
No online option is offered. No alternate times are offered. No test-out is offered. In addition to being disorganized and unprofessionally last minute, it also is university misconduct to not attempt to make a reasonable allowance for a student requiring a reasonable religious accomodation. (Me, asking for an alternative to attending classes on Sabbath.)
So anyways, I weighed my interest in this particular program at this particular school against my other options and desire to not take out loans, etc., and determined that I no longer had confidence in this school or its direction
person_76 that's absolutely atrocious. That is.... borderline illegal stuff.... I hope you. didn't put any money down already or at least that its reversible. I'm so sorry person_74
It should be reversible, the max I'll be out in the worst case is probably a month's rent.
And yeah, it sucks, fortunately I have good options. It sounds like at least half of the class is going to have real problems as well, and I don't know if they're in as good of a situation to get out of it.
What will you do? Work 'til options open??
I'll apply to organization_1 for Fall 2017, work on my portfolio, look for jobs, and get a nice part time job to cover student loans until an industry job is gotten, or until I start at organization_1. I also now have my mind clear to consider law school again, and I realized my LSAT may qualify me for a 50-75% scholarship at organization_9 law school.
I wouldn't stay there, if I went, I'd transfer up after the first year, which is a common practice.
So yeah, frustrated, but it's only a minor delay in life, and I'll survive
Looking at apartments and jobs in WL as early as tomorrow, depending on what the email from organization_10 says.
sure :)
I'll try to reserve 303 for thurs from 8-10 later today
Cool. Do you think I could get my ID to work for the door too that time?
wait haha ur ID?...
person_77 said I could
oh really??
where r u rn?
Class lol
I am doneeeee
person_78 asked restaurant_1 tomorrow at time_1.?
I can do that sure?
I thought we were going to plan it, gosh. 
Are you coming to campus?
Soonish?
Lunch together or no?
Probably not. I do not know yet. I will let you know when I am about to leave.
I might go to hil silvas place?
For lunch?
Just in general. 
Okay.
