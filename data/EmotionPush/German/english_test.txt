ohh no
I still have so much to study for 213
I'm going to spend most of tomorrow doing practice exams
:O
Maybe I should try to finish comp apps and studying for Nature of Mathematical Reasoning tonight
when's that
I gave the rest of my DoubleShots to my friend, he needs them more than I do, he has 213, 18-290 signals and systems, and matrices all on Thursday
Nature of Mathematical reasoning is 1pm on thursday
person_0
why didn't he ask for change of schedule
I don't thikn they would have allowed it because he scheduled his own 213 exam
He originally had it for tomorrow but then that would have been 6 hours that he needed to study for 18-290 and matrices
So he pushed 213 back to Thursday
dnagggg
that's craszy
To find out more about the job.
Oh I see. And they just told you that you'd be hitting the emergency stop?
How much is the pay?
Also. Would you be able to come to NY memorial day weekend?
I do not know. I need to find out my schedule first.
Okay... did you hear back from anyone?
Have you tried engineeringjobs.com LOL
Engineerjobs*
So its playable rn
Almost
Once we have the person_1 and at least 2 Holy Flame, then he was gonna start playing the deck.
Ahh icic
Yeah
Plus I'mma get SP Sleimy Flares so I'll hand him my other 2
Oh btw, ordering shit soon (both Mint and location_0). Anything you want me to see if I can get it?
G1 clear
PRISM Image, Clear, right?
Is that the G1
http://images.yugiohmint.com/b/b1374606611BT090009.jpg
person_2
How many?
1
k
Lol
Anything else?
where are the CEE clusters?
In the far corner of person_3
oh yea I know
alright
There's usually never anyone who's not a CivE in here lol
The only person I've ever seen in here who's not a civE is person_4
And the cleaning guy
I went in there once with person_5
person_6
because there was a stapler
How'd you get in?
idk how he got in
Lol
door might have just be open
person_7 is here
I mean person_8
He wants his laptop charger
I'm aware 
Me too! I'm so happy for person_9!
yeah, and lol at her sending that text to person_10
person_11
What do you think will happen with location_1 and person_12 with location_2?
i think person_12 and location_1 should both leave
Yeah, I would not be mad at that
But if they fight over her then I feel like person_12 would win
Also I hate that person_13 and person_14 are fighting
Yeah, I don't really understand how location_1 has a case
Same, like I get that they are her parents but did she adopt location_2, if not she isn't blood related so I feel like not really gonna win
I mean, I guess I am
I just woke up
Uh do you have a charger? Like iPhone charger
Maybe? 
I'm on my way, I'll figure it out
What's the number thing?
It doesn't work, you should wait anyway, because I have to get a haircut today
Aight I'll message you if I'm going
It's so hard not to cry
What heppen
I lost another 3 set game
is ok person_145
Why does it hurt so much
everybody loses
because you are too competitive
I just dont want that game to be the decider
Like what if we could get bronze today but we don't bc I. screwed ipp so bad on the third set
well that wasnt your teams only loss
you win or lose as a team
And they kept on targeting me bc they know I'm weaker and it feels so awful
I hate playing on teams bc you let down so many people
I want my mistakes to be just my owm
im sure your teammates made mistakes too
I know but we could've actually won this game
oh
I hate these tournaments
then why do you play if you dont enjoy it
all you ever do is complain when you're playing badminton
yeah but each problem set is worth like 1% of your grade
orly....well i like doing those more lol
but yeah i really dont have a number grade for my total it just says score_1
i guess i'll try to calculate it lol
oh his grade sheet is too hard to read
lol yeah its so complicated wtf cant he just use blackboard..
ann doesnt have a letter or a number total grade LOL
i THINK if i dont do this and only get score_2 on the final i'll still get score_3
gud enuf yoloswag
hey person_153 did you buy graduation tickets?
what do you mean? like extras?
yeah
you made a post a while ago that you were looking to buy
how much did you pay for them, if you did?
yeah 2 from person_156 but I'm always in the market
i'm trying to sell mine
lol
that person_153, flipping graduation tickets
Aight how much you want for them?
and how many do you have to sell?
i just wanted to know how much you paid for person_15's
idk if i'm selling the rest of mine yet
Oh well person_15 actually gave them to me free
lal
well
But I ended up giving him like $10 for each
i way way undersold the one I sold already
that's nice
person_16 said he thought 40-50 would be a reasonable first offer
*t
and I sure could use that x5
dang wow I wouldn't pay more than $30 but I'm not desperate
Wanna grab dinner
And then review lab?
sounds good
Cool see you at west Union
Let me know when you
Want to meet
i already ate, i'll come over though
Oh cool
See you soon
Hey person_17
Sorry about this but can I get an extension? :D
Hehe. Me too
I got an assignment due today and kinda stuck there

I'll send you my part at latest tomorrow at 10 am
You're fine
Ok
Your deadline is Tomorrow night
Since we'll meet day_1
We have msd rq due on Tuesday...
What do you suggest?
Can I do the compiling part by Tuesday evening 6pm?
After the msd lecture....
Alright in that case I suggest you send this in the group discussion, and suggest we review it together at a later date
Personally I'm ok
With this
Okay thanks man
Yo get one of the buddyfight channels to get person_18 into a discussion. I want to hear that man say wow
Lol
XD
I'm tired
Gotta set up this mymathlab shit
person_19?
Yeah
And do some social science homework too.
What class do you use person_19 in?
Algebra
Did you take the card? The one in the camera doesn't have any of the shots on it. I'm confused.
All of my cards are devoid of pictures.
I'm confused
The card that was in the camera yesterday
Aka the pictures you took lol
Exactly the one in it just has your pics on it.
Weird. Upload that, I'll check mine when I'm out of class
Like you checked all folders?
person_20. I'll put em on snaxandspex
Alright.
I'm going in class now and can't use my phone
Okay that's cool. They'll be there after.
kk
on a separate note, my friend says everything else is really good, so i'd like to confirm the first 2 months!
the last month (after the other guy moves in), im not so sure about yet
hope you understand!
hey yeah no I completely understand
we can def confirm the first 2 months
I'm asking person_154 for person_21's fb, that's the guy
I know he's moving here to start a PhD but he's her friend from college so I've not met him personally
When she gets back to me I'll try to put you guys in touch, but if you decide to move out in Aug that's cool
ahh ok so at least she knows him, not some random stranger (:
thank you so much!
do you want to prepare a sublease?
yeah no not at all
haha we wouldn't have been comfortable taking on random guy subletters either
so I understand your worry
haha great
sure. so should I just confirm it for may 15 - end of June for now?
so i did some research on subleasing stuff, and apparently the following should be present:/n1. duration of sublease/n2. name, home address and business address of subtenant (me)/n3. name, address of the tenant (you) during sublet period/n4. copy of proposed sublease which should contain tenant's original lease/n5. signature of landlord, tenant, subtenant
yup can confirm till whatever date person_154's friend is moving in
do you know the exact date?
Not yet, I'll finalize with her and let you know by tomorrow night. I'll prepare a draft of the sublease and you can sign it when you move in
sure!
thank you so much!
huh so you're still going to 100 iterations...
interesting
100?
in the SOR
only until iter 10 ish
oh what the shit
this is a lot of n
what?
oh do you mean your code?
no i'm running yours right now
SOR is only 100 until 10 ish
overall runs to get to 6.4 is around 818
person_157 got about the same but we might be wrong?
i dunno
Haha ok let me know
So I didn't go either lol
But I asked prof
He said he will give hw after this chapter gets over
Oh ok
and hw is from the textbook
Nice
He has to still decide which problems
Hehe thike
gonna work your ass off on tuesday though?
i am not sure... might have work of my own to do
i'd probably have to be on campus most of the day regardless
attending a watch party on tuesday night though?
there will probably be some
i might try to attend one
I'm wondering if I should go to one
since studying can be always put off till a later time...
true, tuesday might be the most interesting day of the week
other than the fact that it's the day the metro breaks down the least...
jk I actually made that up, and now I probably jinxed it
hopefully won't break down when you actually need it
haha
the watch party I think I might go to does require the metro
because it's in location_1
lol hopefully it won't stop you
we'll see
but other than that, how's life?
same old stuff pretty much
still in the proces of outlining
sounds like you have the general contours of the paper down, if you're in the outlining stage
some contours are there, i guess, others need to be more well defined
I don't see anything wrong with the function
Are you running my test on that?
yup
hmmmmmm
Maybe its my isqueue
But then it runs perfectly on C
I meamc1
Does your Autolab output say anything about it?
tfw a professor gives u hope but then emails u to tell u he wont in fact be able to take u off the waitlist :^)
and now u dont kno how to fill the hole in ur schedule :^)
bc that was the last waitlist class u were waiting on :^)
at least ur glad u didnt buy the textbook yet :^)
but still :^))))))))))))))))))))))))
fuckin :^)))))))))
:^(
pls :^))))))))))))))))
What class?
how people work
its a design class
required for design sophomores but like
there are only like 35 of them
and on SIO the class max says 45
but 43 people showed up on day one and the professor was like "whoa who are all these people"
so like idk whats up
8 of us from the waitlist showed up
idk if any of them are getting admitted or not
I love you
Idk how to convey a grumble through a smile in text
urghbrlmm
?
I love you
We had cake for my brother's birthday
Yum
That's late
12 days late
Oops
I want to kiss you
I know
I want to hold you in my arms and just enjoy the moment
I want to be held by you, safe and secure and happy
I want to run my hands through your hair
It's finally cooling down
We could fall asleep together
I want to lie my head on your chest and just listen to you breathe
To lean back and close my eyes and just feel you by my side
I love you
I love you too
I wish I was with you right now
:) 
That awkward moment when i am so sleep deprived I'm falling alseep and delirious at work
On the plus side things are 200x funnier
Lol true, but work will be over soon. In like 20 minutes right?
person_22
Then sleep and food
Not in that order
Do both at the same time
Sleep eating seems dangerous
Not if you do it right :)
haha ok i just confirmed with her im taking it until that guy moves in
thank you!!!
yeah 2 mths is long enough to find other accomodation
but i dk who will hold you up for 1 mth though
it might be 1.5months not 2 haha but still better than nothing
yea :/
dunno, see how first
the guy is her friend so its not some random stranger
if he seems fine i'll ask my parents if theyre ok with me just staying there
Hey person_23! Do u need more play testers?? My boyfriend is visiting and Id like to bring him as well. Is that OK?
YES!!!
The more the better!!
Awesome!
Haha
Thank you! :D
Haha alright, I'll msg u when I'm there time_1?
Sure!
Np! Wanted to give him a tour of ETC
Hahaha ok
Anyw I'll ttyl! Having rehearsals now
Gl!!!
Oh fuck my entire life I keep forgetting
haha it's fine
we can just exchange when they give graduation tickets out
God dammit my mom just said not to get it
aw rip
lol
If you want I can hang onto it for a couple days
Otherwise that's fine
So you can give it to someone else
Cool, no prob
Good thing you forgot :p
Now I've got to remember to bring in that $10
Dude person_24 is just gonna stroke himself
Get person_25 or person_26
Or even person_27
spoke with my friend just now
we r indeed will get to those stage later on
but first, local
Lol
Alright
dont think we can play and doing it on cfa looks shit
but we can still get into discussion or as a get international players as guest caster
I mean, game plays videos get alot less views than discussion ones
oh idk that
well regarldess, we will have quality gameplay + quality casters
Damn lol
example if we play shadow vs idk gc
i can invite u as guest caster, with me as main caster
similar to football matches where 1 caster do play by play and the other 1 do the analysis
mostly the guest will do the analyst
and match the clans in the video with the main clan of the guest caster
to get better insight
thats what i have in my head for now at least
Haha near the soccer fiel
You guys still waiting?
Yup!
Haha near normlee?
Yeah haha near there
person_28 next bus need to wait super long leh
We're getting on 61c now!!

hey person_158! ive a super random question: how many game programmers are there usually on a game?
its for a game design pitch im doing for a class haha we need to come up with a realistic budget but i dont even know whats a realistic number of programmers :/
20%
wha
for most project
thats a lot isnt it
indie team can go till like 60%
WHA
wait ok 60% of all the programmers or of all the staff
or the budget
im confused haha
so say a team of 10
in indie
6 would be programmers
oh so the entire staff??!
wowwww
ok hmm

hey so idk if we're actually meeting today, but organization_1 is going to drop off the table today
so could a couple of you help carry it into the stairwell or whatever?
one or two people for maybe 5 mins
should be p quick
we're definitely meeting today! we had a mentor issue but it's resolved now. so if you haven't emailed admin, we are expecting you to be there!
sweet, thanks for the info
but yeah if anyone can go help person_144 that would be gr8
i'll just grab someone from the cave
hey when and where are we seeing civil war? my mom needs to know
these fuckers are starting mother's day dinner at 4, for some reason
1
ok so then it'll go until time_1ish
i haven't looked up exact movie times but that was the expectation
that should...probably work? Is it possible to see it any earlier
well idk about the brunch plans
also are we going to location_1 or location_2
no clue
whichever works best
also my mom pointed out that mother's day is basically the worst day of the year to go out to brunch
oh
well not if we go to the one by pitt probably? i don't know anyone's mom who would go there
I'm not entirely sure that holds for organization_2 though, since probably not that many moms go to college. but idk
yeah
yessssss ^^ haha I'll probably be on craig st then
cause I gotta help my friend with this website thing
yaaaaaaay!
thats kay :))) what time did we say? like 5?
like 5:30?
okay!
hopefully its early enough that there isnt a huge wait but if there is we can go to that restaurant incubator place hehehe
OH the smallman galley? :D
that place is good too~
though i've only been there once lol
yeeeeeeeeee
same
Guess we're not seeing each other </3
NOOOO
Im sad now :'(
lets form our own group
defect from team 14
Okay what's our team name 
team 69: organization_25. Now we can meet whenever we want and discuss how to spread cuteness to make the world cutepositive
Omg that is great 
What's the first step
the first step is creating a team charter and a formal mission statement
We'll have to discuss how we want to spread our message of cutepositive
Okay that sounds like a lot of work
I don't know if I want so put in that much effort
hmmm. Let's skip the charter and mission statement and just focus on being cute together. Our combined cuteness will spread throughout the world
and we'll be a beacon of hope for humanity
Mmk
I got a few before.
Are they worth it?
I think they're kinda cool
Is there a shirt in all of them?
Yup! Usually a choice between 4 of them randomly.
Ooooooo
Maybe il try it
How much did it cost when u did it?
Get one!
$20
Oh it's cheaper now like 13$. Unless shipping makes it 20 hah
Well dope haha
ok
i got the lte on
and i positioned supports in my case so that bumping into the sim card tray is unlikely
i'm going to send it back to organization_3 when i get the nano to micro sim converter i just ordered from amazon
EVERYTHING WILL BE OK

i appreciate your supportive hand gestures
and your patience because this is all i've been talking about for a while
Hahaha
er ok slight problem
one of our actors has some last minute matter to attend to tonight
so it looks like we're gonna have to cancel our playtest D:
im so sorry T.T
Haha it's ok
Anyway
Nowadays I should be more free since classes have pretty much ended
Just let me know if you need ppl for the next playtest!
no exams?
Got
we're probably postponing it to next mon evening
But just no more labs etc in the evening
ahh ok
Ah ok
Yeah next Mon sounds fine
awesome!
thank you so much man
i'll let you know again!
Np! Ok :)
organization_4 ka details
to transfer 11$ every month
You can do via Pop money right?
What's pop money?
For that account number is needed?
It's a organization_4 to organization_5 account transfer
okay
But I don't think you can set that up to be automatic monthly
I saw an option to schedule a transaction
Yeah that's bill pay I think
Acha, let me check that get back to you
I'm at my dad's job and his coworker was trying to get me to make Ethernet cables for him :P
Lol
Oh I forgot to tell you I went back yesterday to put up my thing and someone threw it out
Oh my god noooooooo
I'm so sad
Literally who's going to clean stuff out now it's not even the end of school for everyone else
Yeah idk/nThe scanner was moved a little too
Idk
Am I supposed to be walking to your house?
u can sleep too we are just watching haikyuu
It's ok, I wanna see person_35 b4 I leave
ok don't sweat too much
I am still in bed lol
What are u guys doing for lunch?
Maybe I can meet up w you
maybe bk... lol
That's a pretty far walk rip
For you guys I mean
Are you getting a car?
maybeeeeee
Woah
Nice
If you guys are going to bk I might as well meet you there because by the time I get your house you'll probably be heading out anyways
my nasties, what does this mean
like all columns defined as the primary key are part of a single one?
that seems kinda obvious
I read it at first as meaning only one column can be part of the PK
you can have multiple columns as part of a PK, but there's only one PK per table
if that  makes sense
yeah ty
I should have stared at it a little longer
(y)
np my nasty
I hate that so much I'm so sorry
because I keep feeling doing it using something else would be way faster
But yeah I know they needed us to learn something now
I'll get comfortable with rust soon :p
sorry for complaining :P i think im complainig just because i have to work and i didnt want to :P
lol. I know that feeling
like right now. I'm just playing games because I don't want to do work...
it would have been easier if i am constantly busy
having less coursework has made me lazy now
I might have a job teaching English on Saturdays
Yay extra money
Ooh like at an academy?
person_36
I'm trying it today
How many hours?
If I like and if they like maybe I'll do it
Not sure yet
Coolio ^_^
High school rallies get worse and worse
Of course lolol
It's just guys shaking their butts

There's a bunch of new teachers at our school now
So they were playing musical chairs in front of everyone
And they broke a chair while trying to sit down lololol
so we will meet you in the circle at 8am tomorrow
ya
sounds good
So, what do you think we should bring?
just... water....
camera, water, money for food
maybe something to do in the car when youre not driving
ok
Back
Well I shouldn't have anything else to do on then
since like it's prom
I'm free
what should we do?
i think I'd suggested person_37's suggestion of a french restaurant you'd already been to
Do you have money from ticketsV
?*
So person_38 backed out
So I only have 1 sale rn
You should offer less
That's the 45 I owe you :p
yeah
I'll make the rounds again tomorrow I guess
I need to get those sold
You do
I don't want to ask you to go out somewhere where it's gonna be expensive, you know
I know
I want to go somewhere nice with you
I'd hate my poor finances to be an obstacle
Made it to 25 :)
that's my boy
link_0
Haha yus
Also i cannot find the right kessler for tuts -_-
it's the organization_23

Same.
did you pitch the idea to person_160
Yes. He's in lol
sweet
Whenever we get it, theyre estimating Wednesday but shipping could be delayed
Alright
Also since youre in champaign itll probably only take 2 days max to get to your place once we ship
Where are you located?
location_4
Oh sweet
That's not far at all
Yup yup
I visit organization_6 occasionally haha
Oh nice. Yea. It's a pretty nice campus. Come check out our card shop next time. We have tournaments on day_1 at time_1
If you have the time that is :p
Hahaha alright
Yeah I go to location_5 so I have some friends at organization_6 that ive met through competitions and such
Nice :) yea I've met a few people from location_5. It's a benefit of the campuses being close to each other.
Pretty much yeah lol
Can you get me on soul mart list
Hey you doing alright kid?
Also not sure. I heard organization_26 board got blacklisted
.....but I'm not on board and I haven't been to an organization_26 gbm  since the beginning of this semester
And yeah I'm fine

Idk mb he wants to be a vendor
To be fair we're gonna be buying a case of every set
*main set
I mean we're not building the stuff out of the sets (for the most part)
I mean sell splits, buy singles
Sounds good to ms
*me
Yeah exactly
but like, I wouldn't buy into a set/clan split
It's not bad for things like set 2 AqF
Cause 6 lambros
person_41 shot to 5
*50
$$$$

oopps sorry
Synapse Fund Code: (811-2052)
copy past :P
got it haha
thanks
Nope not cute
Dont call me cute
Gross lol
Why 
What did you do 
You're cute
Lol i like the glasses though
One time the 112 CAs were taking this test called the Rice Purity Test where you start off with 100 points and there's a list of 100 things and every time you check off a thing on the list you lose a point 
And he made us take it too
And we both took it again today and I got a 50 and he got a 60
And some of them are related to drinking lol
Oh and person_43 doesn't drink
What is that 
Let me try it lol
ricepuritytest.com
I made you lose a bunch of purity points lol
Wow, but he lives in your suite
Lol yeah he's the only one who doesn't drink in my suite
Haha
How many steps per day ?
Don't overexert
Am joining muay Thai today yaaaaay
person_44
Let me know how it is
I might join later
Okie
I bought gloves yaaay
Cant wait to punch some stuff
hahahah
will be very satisfying
i bet
person_45 until the point I get beaten up
hahahaha
you will make for a very good punching bag
Hahaha true true
I can't wait for my gloves to arrive
I ordered yest and it says will arrive in krach today
organization_10 is epic
you have prime na
Yes feel free to bindas ask
If u want to use
awesome
I do have a question for the probabilitiy homewokr
Refer to 4.b --> Standard Deviation of the total cost
the cost one?
yeah, its just the standard dev times 300
yea
because its in 000s
mmhm what was that # u got?
let me see if I can find the sheet
kk ty
think it was in the neighborhood of 450
i tried 2 things - and neither one was right
459.6465 (what person_46 had) - was wrong...
and if it wasn't that - i had put in 600k... which was also wrong
can you check to see which answers you submitted?
on canvas
i submitted both of those (just did it right now)
ok
It wont let me see my answers
but I remember my answer being basically what person_164 had
and I'm 10/10
That's weird
eh whatever dont care too much
Aight, do you wanna just meet there?
Sure, probably easier to meet at 3rd and 9th and walk to boka, it's a real quick walk. Nearby subway stops include astor place (6) and 8th st organization_11 (NQR)
Actually the 8th st stop doesn't have downtown service stopping there on weekends currently so if you're on NQR you'll have to stop at 14th st union square and walk down
Yeah, that's what they were saying
We probably don't need to get food immediately if that works ok for you guys
Oh yeah, i was thinking later anyway
We're pretty much out of stuff to do and we're heading back from flushing now, so we're probably just going to bum around until 3 or so
Unless you're dtchill right now
I'm working on packing/generally clearing out my room atm so I'll probably just let you know when person_165's free and we can meet up then
No worries, that sounds good too
YAY!
Our game starts at 7 when the shuttle reach, should end by 745
Yup PTC = ETC shuttle
good!
There's one leaving morewood at 645
person_47 is coming too, so maybe you guys can come tgt or smth!
Thank you (:
Ok :)
welcome!
If any of your friends are free, bring them along!!
Back
I love you
I love you too
It didn't work
rip
i'll go look
maybe try 99.140.177.174:25565
it looks like everything's configured right
I updated the vex curriculum in the spreadsheet
Can you take a look tonight
yes
Also it didn't work
So that moment where I need to get a competitive decks volume 2 binder.
What
Yeah
The first one is too full
How
I put cards in.
But like... you use the 16 pocket ones
I use standard binders for YGO
organization_12 is the only 16 pocket one I use
Ohhh mb you should move to 16
The only problem is I have to constantly buy them online.
Ohhhh
Like shit
You can ask person_166 to bring them in
it took forever to find my 1
Cause they can order supplies
true, but that's inconvenient, plus it's not as nice for YGO
I mean... you could move to a literal binder
With those removable pages
I do not trust those things at all tbh
I mean industrial ones
I still have to talk baseball w my mom but I'll let you know soon p
ok
watch this amazing video
(sounds good :))
Me too thanks
But actually that's so impressive
me irl
rings are fucking crazy
Oh it's the olympics this summer
huh
I can put you down
For NN
Oh sweet, can I get some more info about the 4 copies of commons/rares thing? That sounds like something I wanna do.
Yeah we can drop the price on it by 5-10$ maybe more if you do that so can minimize shipping fees
I can put it on my list to discuss with you when payment comes around, since we don't have exact shipping estimates
You don't have to pay shipping btw
It's just we were gonna discount you based on the difference in shipping costs.
Oh alright, thanks
For the sake of things, what kind of prices would I expect to have to negotiate around if you pulled the Neo Nectar clan pack?
It's okay
person_20
Bleh my knee is still fairly weak/swollen
Man stop soccer
I only played for 20 minutes
Then stopped to take it easy
Lol
Well so you learned that you should only play for less than 20
Your knee is by no means good dawg
You didn't buy right cause I told you not to think about tvix ?
Kinda
At a healthcare session
Kinda?
Wait you did buy lol
I didn't buy
good
there's not enough data to tell yet
but I did tell my boss that we shoudl buy yesterday
but then TVIX dropped in the afternoon after being flat at 2%
Oh well
I mean I do trust you in some aspects but I also know you jump in too early hahaha
and leave too late
Especially with women
lol
naw with women you don't have shit haha
:0
well they might as well be men with feelings
Talking about gbf

Alternatively I can meet tomorrow at 6 too!
Thanks (:
Today you're free from 6 until when?
Till 615 only, unfortunately :/
I only have that tiny break
Ah and where will you be on campus
At Hunt!
Okay that works! I'm not sure where I'll be at 6, either in donner or in location_8. So if I'm in location_8, could we meet in baker? And if I'm in donner I can come to hunt
Haha should be fine but I'm not that familiar with the buildings as my faculty is off main campus!
Oh are you a grad student?
person_48 is just the building if you walk out of hunt, turn left and walk straight in
Yup grad student (:
Thanks!
But I can message you sometime before 6 to let you know where we can meet

person_49
I'm pleased I guess
You guess?
Nice thing to balance out their fight
Aw
It was rather one-sided

Anyway they thought I was going out
We can talk about it later I guess
Omg you get to meet my cat

Oh That is awesome!!
:D
I will also prepare myself for meeting haha
also i feel like you should know: person_179 admitted he also likes guys
WHAT
WHY IS THERE NO LONK CHARACTER IN FATES UGH
Asugi openly admits what we know person_50 did
YEA
like, it's in his and Rhajat's S support. i didn't get them together but i watched it out of curiosity
Wait. Their S support?
yeah
LOL
She tries to come up with a curse that will let him trail his targets silently, but the only way she could get it to work is if the person had feelings of love for their target
WAIT OMG
Basically like
there may not be a lon'qu character afraid of girls in fates, but there IS a female character who is afraid of boys, who person_179 can date in revelation...
and she's literally fujoshi. she translates her fear of boys by always imagining the HOT YAOIS.
I heard of this. Wait, I REMEMBER HEARING ABOUT THIS
HOT YAOIS
person_51's daughter, person_52
oho
OHOHO
who is going to  be my daughter in conquest because i'm marrying niles
GETS MY CHILDREN HITCHED
OH MY GOSH PLS
Who you gonna marry in revelations *0*
person_53...eheh
I'm not, sorry. What's up?
they just made a big change to the lock system apparently and I'm worried its gonna mess stuff up for a brief period
like I'm not sure what all was changed and if community members need to immediately go to the info desk to get new IDs and if thats true thats gonna suck because not all of them can access that right away
I'm also not sure if its just the outside lock or like all the locks inside too????
person_54
yeeah
Worst case you can go to student activities?
yeah I mean I might drive down to check out what's up
they're soluble
all the combos
I got it wrong lol
I am assuming they switch order between people
Please help
I was confused why the middle one was none because a precipitate would form
And I got it wrong so idk what to do
yeah, sorry they switched it up
first one is none
wait
nvm all 3 of yours are different from mine
Dang
But should the first one be none technically?
yes
NONE
second one is pbso4
Whoa
Do much work it will be
Be like person_172
Smart young motivating
He would say so many times our project and not mine or his
lol
ill talk to you later properly
i need tips
some stanford berkeley guy will come for sure
person_155 can you send us the final code?

it's a group submission
oh okay
nvm then
wait where from bb?
yeah

wahoo
okay
so
what was your f vals
for it = 2?
actually
for first it, did you have 0.041 from 1 to 33 of 1 to 32?
(F matrix)
Just the interior. So 2:33
Actually yeah 1:33
 And it's at j = 33
Right
1:33??????
Okok lemme check
To verify
Nope nope 2:33. Haha sorry I suck
person_55
Whats wrong with you
I'm not even complaining about you and I HAVE been dealing with it
Can't I just ask that you try not to wake me up tonight?
Yeah okay
And I'm saying I've been trying
And I've never ever cut my nails when you're asleep
That's because I can't so I don't bother sleeping until you're done
There was only ONCE when I cut my nails when you were home
I keep track of when I cut my nails -.-
Then I don't know what's that clipping noise that comes from your side
If I'm making noise and you can't sleep, tell me. Most of the time my lights are not even on by the time you get back
Okay. Sorry for being defensive. It sounded like you were complaining
As in I'm used to it so that's why I never sleep until you're asleep
Unless I'm not feeling well
You were the one who asked me which part
It sounded like you were going on a rage on that
Nvm. Sorry.
I wasn't
Yeah I know. I misunderstood
Yo, aside from all the crap happening, want to see something cool? I started a ranking_1 on website_1, and you're currently 2nd place on there, probably higher once we get more events in. Right now it just has tops from BWC 2015, and a few from year_1. link_1
Damn lol
What events does it include?
Just ARG? KoCF?
For the future I mean, not rn
I don't even have the data_1 yet, but it's set up so We'll have all of the Bushi BWCs and Teams, and all the ARG events. Maybe KOCF/Dynasty/Vongola/etc sometime in the future. The data is proving hard to find, right now it just has organization_13's in it. Not bad though, yeah?
Yeah it's pretty good, this might allow for some kind of circuit to be setup between major organizations like ARG, location_10, KoCF for even more tourneys
That's kinda what I'm hoping.  Still quite a ways to go, but the structure is there.
Im sure with support from organization_14, person_21, person_56 and other major members of the community it would be possible for a location_11 - esque circuit
Since we know person_57 cant run one for the life of them
That would be pretty cool actually.  There are several groups in the area here already talking about starting separate Circuits and/or events.  Tying them all together in the organization_15 would be pretty sweet.  I swear though, person_57 just hates its own game.  It could be way more successful so easily.
It could be, I just think they arent doing enough quality control and care too much about the money. Havent the BWC numbers been increasing anyway?
You have some of the statistics right?
Like honestly if it means I can help this game out, I wouldnt mind judging and trying to help organize things. Playing is amazing and the competition is great but ive heard nightmare stories about judging even at reputable events and that hurts the game more than a good player playing the game.
Some of them, finding player attendance isn't easy.  But some of them have actually decreased.  NY had like ~150 less this year, although it had more for Spring Fest than last year.  location_12 had like ~30 less.
Also, it does, but really, 1 or 2 good judges won't change anything.  They need a program that actually trains people to be VG judges.
I feel like something like this could be started at least domestically between Christian and other major knowledgeable members of the community
Like an NACFV/Van-guardians judge list that ARG, person_57, KoCF, etc can use
Apparently the location_13 ones were down by a lot as well.
I guess we are seeing the effects of bushi's mistakes
Im considering brining up the judge idea to person_25
*bringing
Mm ya, lol I have night classes on Tues and Wed ><
Okie...looking at potential team aha
Ro on percussion
person_58 on bass
person_59 on piano
Ya sounds good to me :)
Mm I'll ask person_60 if she wants to synth or guitar
I'll guitar
How should we pick songs? I feel like we should do about 4?
person_61 and you vocal
And me
Mm 4 works
Okk
Theme related?
To "be still?"
Ya we could try..haha something about listening to God and being patient maybe?
Mhm yep yep
Ok I'm gonna sleep cause early days tomorrow ><
Same. We'll talk about it more tmr
Night
Ok goodnight!
why not
thought you were a ride or die chick guess not
You know what everyone already thinks I drink too much so I can't be surprising them now
exactly exactly
I only ride, I can't die
it would be very jarring
and i think that's the implication
like u do nothing but ride
try to do something else n u die
Exactly
How's your friend situation?
what friend?
or you mean lackthereof?
Yes, mf?
oh......well we can go next year we'll be more fit!
Yeah hopefully I will be fit for tough murder 
person_62

I'm waiting in the lobby for a FedEx package
It should come between 10 and noon
It's 10:15
I am so bored
LOL
why are y waiting for iy
It requires a signature
And they won't hold it at a FedEx facility because the sender specifically requested that it be sent to my address
It's such bs, making my life difficult
omg this girl person_188 is being a huge bitch
so person_147 is married to person_184 who graduated last year. i asked her to design the tilton pint glass, but she was busy so i said no worries we'll figure something out. so i got pei to design it and we got them printed and they are here in my offive
and then today she snapchats me a picture of the design she worked on today, and i immediately texted her saying that we had a miscommunication i'm sorry it's done we don't need your deisgn
and then she's mad at me even though it was no one's fault, it was a miscommunication
giving me sass, so i apologize again and ask her about her yoga practice
and she ignores my question and asks when we need the other designs by, so i told her next year
AND THEN she makes her status, "I'm kinda over how today went. Can it be tomorrow yet so I can start over?"
with a comment saying "Just not having a good day. Things keep going haywire"
like fuck off ok you should have asked me about it before spending the day working on it. which isn't a lot btw, i spent days trying to get the current design figured out
Uhhh she can fuck off
like stop being so passive aggressive. i was about to like it, but i resisted
Yeah no don't do that unless u want war lop
Lol
i don't want war :P
but geez she's just so freaking grumpy about it
and she's such a calm person irl
almost to the point that you're like who are you person_188
Huh
Maybe she's pmsing
haha maybe
btw, "maybe she's pmsing" was assigned the emotion sad haha
I love you
I love you too
You're gonna be here really soon
It's nice outside
I'm glad you're happy
Sorry about last night
What happened last night?
Oh not a problem
Sorry for keeping you up

person_65: Where's your father, person_67? person_68 called me, and she said she hasn't seen him in hours!
person_64: well, he's probably also celebrating national dildo day, did she check the Bushes outside?
person_69: He's not in the bushes anymore! We went looking for him an hour ago!
person_69: This is why I like celebrating dildo day INSIDE! It's so much safer!
person_64: Is mother still searching outside? I hope she brought her cellphone with her
What's it about btw???
Haha I tried watching one of her dramas and gave up halfway soo hahah maybe when I don't have dramas to watch maybe I'll consider it
She really isn't even that pretty haha

True, they take up space in other places
also i didnt use a dishwasher until my sister's (white) roommate let dishes build up to the point that I needed to use it

We should have gone to the mall at 12 AM last night
and break in
and steal things
Ohhhh
person_73 literally passed Cipher Dragon. Why the fuck? @_@;
person_74
Also, why is person_75 the people's champion
Do people like him?
I think it's cause he's the location_15 player and it's a really big deal if location_15 wins.
I think person_76 gonna 2-0 his ass unless finals is BO5
I believe location_15 can do it.
Shunske is OP fam
At least I want to believe
I wish VG had an auto invite system
Then winning worlds would mean something
Or I guess you can be like person_24 and just keep stroking
lol
I think he actually got the most out of worlds
Considering he's on a never ending strokefest
I mean he's gotta compensate for something when his stroke time is so big.
I mean location_16 sucks... he lives a hole, looks like that, probably has a small dick
I think he's compensating for quite alot tbh
Also that moment when people say that person_77 tiger is a minus one
*person_78
Binding Ur-watar or any of your combo pieces is so minus amirite
Totes
Also Fang Rebellion has the potential to kill you from zero
If any of the programmers are free tomorrow morning can you please try to finish the Game Over as well
person_79
I'll buy guys bubble tea
ahhhhhhhhh

But I love it so much
I love you
I'm talking to person_81 but I'll be done in a few
Ok
I'm scanning something so I'll probably be done after
My moms giving me crap re us making out lol

well I mean we do do that
We do do that
:p
Good question
What does she expect us to do?
I'm not 13
(Which makes me sound like 15 but whatever)
Chastely hold hands for a brief period of time
Talk about the weather
person_82
I love you
And I love you
I'm back in my room when you're done
I may or may not have fb messaged my recruiter a picture of a margarita

This place is 10/10
Check it out while it's still new before it becomes 6/10
Yeah
As it currently stands this place is the best food on campus hands down
Bs
What did you get that impressed you this much
A location_18 club sandwich
And a cookie
Also the fact that there is a guy who is just cleaning tables constantly
Also that it's healthy
I mean it isn't too hard to beat the other things on campus
The amount of food for the money is also fair
It's just a combination of the other Culinart places on campus
This is 3.50
that's a weird gif
judy is cute
i was scared of playing soccer until world cup 2010
i hated soccer
oh i loved soccer

So u should come for tmr morning
location_19 state center_1

I need to unpack

lolll
same here
But no one's going to bug you about it if you leave it like that lol
jk it's fine
yes i said no
yeah it wasn't irrational
sorry i'm being annoying but is 9 because there are a lot more different combinations?
and in the wason card task there are a lot less variables?
i'm doing 9 right now
ok
yeah i think it might be the rarity assumption
This is shaping up to be just like last season hahaha
I won my first two and got potg now I'm on a losing streak hahaha
hahahaha yessss
Also the new skins for person_87 are dope

it's very pretty

Go with her
This is not solving my problem
I need human contact from people my own age

Ts
person_94
Aren't I just so angsty
Oh yes. 
I am so angry at dad right now. 
:(
Why
Is it cuz you're dating a white boy
No. It's because we are at restaurant and guy is taking order
And he didn't write it at first and he was slow in taking it and he and my mum are talking in Chinese right
And my dad says in English right in front of him
To my mom
Wow, that's rude
You better check to see he got that all down
And I criticized him for being rude because the server could clearly understand
And we argued about it and I'm just angru
Angry*
Just apologize to him for them
I want to apologize, but the moment has passed. 
You will see the server again

it'll probably only lighten to medium blond
i just love dyeing hair
it's so fun
Hm let me think about it a lil
ok ok
Yes
But the energy is on all bars right
the yellow part
Yeah because the ones in the bottom are the numbers dialed
We are interested in the lower frequencies ie higher scale
Exactly, i don't see any yellow in the higher scales. So I guess I'll have to change the scales to make it narrower
Yeah
Cool
couldn't get it to work, idk why
ran into a lot of strange errors
lmk if you use that tool
for drive
i just downloaded everything in chunks
gross
Tru

Oh

I took organization_16 this morning
Probably bombed the essays, but the rest of it went well
Win!
Yeah, 161 verbal and 168 math

Plenty to get into location_5, location_25, or person_99
You stay!
Anyways, gotta shower before meeting with person_100 and friends
Talk to you soon
Okay
I gotta shower too!
Yay!
We shower together!
Yay!
Shower buddies!

i have 3 cats
You have a lot of pets in our house
I think we should make it bigger
Either behind the staircase up or next to the fireplace
they were really hard to tame
mhm
Lol congrats
fuck i left the siamese behind in the jungle
RIP
Aw rip
person_1 you should stop playing
yeah
You said you were gonna do stuff tofay
Otherwise I'd like to see you :p
mhm
i'll do that MPN
Hey so I've been thinking about my semester, and I don't think I'll be active in apo T^T So I guess you'll have to find another person to host the OST?...
Also, do u know what the best way would be to get in contact with person_101 about this?...cause she doesn't really respond to fb msgs
Ah ok, that's fine!
Hm that's weird I thought she was usually responsive.. but I guess if you want to be inactive you could just not pay dues and you'll automatically become inactive
unless you want to be associate
oh, well maybe I'll try msging her lol
oh ya, there's that, but if I become inactive because I didn't pay dues, I'd still have to pay dues next semester
hmm yeah I'd just try messaging her and see if she responds
okk
thanks!
yep!
I mean he does that
But like we should do something for him
Whenever he does
He has even less money than us
Yeah, I know I'm at least handing the white stone of legends.
Doesnt he have 3 Legend?
Well he says 2 are person_102's so he might need mine
either way I'm handing them to him.
I think it's time we did something with this 8mm fisheye
We got a Sigma 8mm fisheye and a special tripod head to take HDRs with ease
Oh my god yes
the new CD tho
Yours? What?
the octane video on person_26 and person_103
person_104 gotta look it up
so bad luck, they dont have 6m3 anymore
so either we cancel this and try next week, coz its RDV de l'erdre so they dont have anything tom
or we go with the 3m3 one
I think we can manage today with the 3m3 one, pj and I can go to decheterie.
or one can sit on the sofa behind :-P wil drop pj to office too as decheterie is on the way to his work
haha
ok i'll sit on the sofa :)
ok lets do this, we wil manage some how,
great
so I wil come meet you at loceco around 11:50 to not lose time, n then we wil  take the camion and come to our arpt, pj wil be here, then we wil go all three
shouldn"t we take my stuff to the location_1 first ?
yes pj is suggesting the same thing
ok then change of plan, we both come there and we take your sofa first
perfect
phew,,,
:D
lol :D
man shiii
I'm soo poor hah
What about person_105
I miss that nods
Kid*
no idea hahaha he's a good man tho haha
yea i miss playing tennis w/ him :-P
but yea -- people's careers grow and they make money
simple as that
princes' salary shouldn't surprise you @ all
u know thats waht consultants make a year or 2 out
what does person_106 do again?
dad was doing silly things
yeah
Are you connected to your neighbors? Can we talk?
mine is back on
yeah, in a few mins
i'm reloading the stuff I had open
What'd you do w all the cobble?
i'm using it in the Nether
for substrate I guess
I'm gonna make a railway to the blaze area
i'm considering making a legit automated farm instead of just a room you go into to kill things
It will fit.
I think.
Again, I am going to do my best.
;A; I believe in you...
And I have a good best.
I love you.. 
The best best.
I love you too.
You're the bestiest...
hey man did you have a chance to ask anyone else if they were having the same problems?
Gimme a half hour to test

is your email person_177@purdue.edu
yes
Damn theres class in all the labs right now
try when you can, did you only get to chance from 346?
Our computers were respawned over the summer so we don't have qube
oohh, i think it's up to ECN to make sure all the right programs are installed and they maybe didnt install the right version of qube
(we'll get it at some point)
Well I tried from 306 and from 340
both dont have the organization_24 authentication tab on the render node in location_26?
correct
gotcha
you're about to get cc'd but we think that whoever is in charge of installing programs just did regular Qube and not the rcac version of the installer which lets you type in organization_24 credentials in houdini itself to render
Alright. So theoretically every user could do it, just need the other qube version
yeah, its going up the grapevine
thanks
when they CC me I'll ask for installers to do it myself in 346
I got icing all over my pants
Looked like I came all over myself
...
no bueno
you should only come all over me ;)
Sorry
it's ok i guess
It wasn't actual come. It was icing.
lol
=;
is it good buns
Yes
good job will
did you make from scratch?
Lol no of course not
oh
wanna do research?
jk those don't really count for anything, but they're easy A's
what kind of research :P
i might already be doing some though haha
i dunno
btw what are you doing this summer?
research
first half here at least
gotta finalize that
I'm by the printer
In hunt
On the first floor
Ahh I'm talking to my prof
Give me a min I'll try to run
I gotta go I'm sorry I'm late for class
Oh man ok
I'm so sorry
What time do you end?
Maybe I can stay around
time_1
I will try to come back!!
I'm so sorry my prof is still talking =-
yeah, sure
who all is going so far?
also when were you thinking of?
Ummm well we don't have a date yet but rn it's person_107, will, person_108, person_109, person_97, person_110, maybe person_111, person_178, maybe person_112, and idk I can't name everyone lol

Yeah lol WHY'D YOU UNFRIEND ME
oh oops
we haven't done much talking
i keep my friend count real low
aw i'm sorry
sometimes i'm too quick to cut it down
No lol it's okay
i'm probably gonna be re-friending a lot of edison people after our little reunion
I just thought you hated me lol but it's really cool honestly
yikes nope
sorry about that
It's coooooool so I'm thinking the 18 or 25?
doesn't look like I have anything either of those days
sounds good
Awesome I'll give you final date soon=�
soeey
sorry
i'm studying rn
its in quad
gah is it open
the door
and where exactly in the quad
i'm not sure if it is
but it should be in the desk drawer
in the desk that's directly in your line of vision when you walk in
so the one all the way on the left
okie
Steadily dropping my competitive rank since 2016
lol
Dropped over 100 points already.
did the top all efficient, working on bottom next
Mmmmm that's dope
one continuous drops through
Mmmmmm
gonna do that under hang
Oh hell yes
nope do u know if anyones home
upstairs
and u need to pack gurl
time_1 tonight
do you think it'll be fully packed on the first day
yes
and i don't think so
this has happened before
my buddy had to go somewhere else freshmen yr cus everything filled up first day or the first few days
:/
darn
when are you meeting with person_148?
I just emailed him!
But I think
like for the first one for finding the unknown acid
use any concentration of NaOH and put in like 1mL at a time until the pH jumps
and when it jumps its ur equivalence point
so just divide that general pH by 2
and thats pKa
of the unknown acid which you match to the table
for finding concentration of the acid u have to be more exact about finding the equiv point
so you'd have to do add in the NaOH little at a time and find as precise as possible the equiv point and the amount of OH you added to get to that point
and then do the math lol
im working on it now and it seems to make sense
T-T
thank you
my phone has messenger
oh
me too. am i constantly green too?
idk
it says you're active now
yes. well i am on fb
wait let me close it
it still says you're active
anybody going to be around tonight to iron banana or something else
I know we talked about Drinking through VOG
I'd be more into banana thoug
I've got a basement show till like 11/12 but I'd be down for some late night ignorant bungalow
'ignorant bungalow'
top kek
but yeah I have nothing to really do this weekend other than drink and play destiny
so I might be down if I'm still up
You bring cake?
You want cake?
You bring cake?
I have cake
You bring?
Are you asking me if I can bring the whole thing out with me?
Yes
Sure. Could you bring the cutlery. I'm all out
person_113
just got a sextuple kill
person_114
Just got an inhaler
nice I just got an ekg
I had an x-ray if that counts haha
haha yeah
person_152 we're dying
just a lil bit
They gave me a steroid so ima get fucking huge
small penis
BUT BIG GAINS
lol
person_115
oh boy
That's a fucking killer lineup.
Hmmm
My vote goes between bike and experience
basically my question is wtf do people spend their money on if they're making ends meet and like, have hobbies that don't require money spending
...
You have enough to travel?
like i very feasibly see how people who are doing alright can just develop drug addictions
like, rent is good? you eating? everything hygenic? perfect, do whatever the fuq you want
and then some people get relationships
and some buy dogs
I think flying to a location_15 city on the weekend would be cool as fuck
i might save some
for beach goth
Nice
i implore u to do that same
When that again?
october
lol
For text classification as in? What I used for mltm?
Yeah
Actually for that we didn't use any library functions
We implemented it all ourselves
Hmm 
Have you worked with any libraries anyways?
I think svms do well on text
For 601, that's it
Hmm okay
Yeah on text, for classification, multiclass svm and logistic should be decent.. What's your classification problem?
For person_116
It's a 2 class classification task
Here we're just classifying sentences 
Not even documents
Hmmm.. So we had a similar problem for mltm, logistic regression gave 60%.. But that was 5 classes, and that was not the standard library function..
If it's two classes, and if you use sklearn, it'll definitely be much better
And you can try svms too, if your data won't be linearly separable
Which it probably won't since it's text
You can use kernels
Yeah that's why I guess they say generally svms do well
I finished the episode person_186
but the end cut off!!
what? 
What did you miss?? 
she met up with person_117 and then it cut off!!
Whaaat
I think they.. 
Are in love again? 
Study
we are bitch
also i can give you minecraft whenever
Yay
How
I mean server access
you bought it right?
Yeah I bought it
yeah
we just give you the server number
and then you plug it in and connect
Okay
server address is server_1
you also need to install some mods
and feed the beast
person_143 can help you do that
actually person_143 can do all this for you
Did you make it to organization_17?
Or are you stuck in some location_27 boonies?
Literally dead
just kidding I'm like probably 45 minutes away from you and BC
Ok drive on!
I might have to pee in a cup
LOLOLOL
Ew gawd
When can you give me your lot?
Kit?
When do you want to meet up? I don't have it with me today but I can give it to you this week
Tomorrow? During the day?
I have a break from time_ to time_2
I can after 3:20 yeah
I have class from 8:30-3:20 nonstop tomorrow
Ok
Is it true we will only use them for the first few weeks?
First half
Then you use the PLD
what but everything gets procrastinated on
thats not special
romantic feelings don't
that's the kind of thing people plan meticulously for
are you saying these arent romantic feelings?!?!
i thought we had something special </3
Noooo. I'm saying that by procrastinating despite having these feelings makes it special
i think it's symbolic. A sign of understanding and a willingness of be open minded and break norms
Gonna sleep now
Okay good night hunny!!!
Miss you super much
Miss you too my love
Add lot's of oil
Sketchy Craigslist offer
I'll email back when I'm upstairs
Hm
Not giving a company name is a bad sign
Mhm
That looks pretty sketch
I guess you could try and find out more
Bet I could write a script to do it for me if it's for real
Lol
You're deffs a cs guy
:p
I read some stuff about Python OCR
?
Text processing
Apparently there's at least one Python library (meaning it'd be easy to use)
What for tho?
It's probably transcribing scanned PDFs or something
Oh like that job thing
did you finish the smart phone hw?
yeah it barely took 30 minutes haha
Cool. Did you just send the text to yourself and test it on your phone?
Or did you do it with the emulator?
on phone
you have an android?
yus
good
I should be good
hey thanks! yea if i can try them on that would be great! (:
We live in location_1. When would u be free?
could i try the top and maxi skirt? the short skirt is a bit too short for my liking
yupp sounds good :)
haha ive no idea what west wing is :/ my building is off campus so im not that familiar with the buldings on main campus!
hahah its the building next to resnik and across from location_36 next to the UC
ooo ok
hmm would tmr around 4-430 be good for you guys?
im not free today!
yeah the works!
you should see the sign for west wing when u walk past resnik cafe
ok!
thank you (:
just let me know when ur downstairs and ill come get u :)
sure!
just chilling
watching videos
maybe play some video games later on
what are you doing
Watching a movie
ahh what movie
It's a Hindi movie
I don't usually watch them on my own, my friend picked it
That's good to know. I'll email the person on my end to let her know too. Let me know if like every single person can't do it so I can explain the situation to the higher ups. It's very fixable but I honestly think whoever was supposed to admin the credentials either forgot or doesn't have a tech background and doesn't understand. Either way I'll let them know
Yeah if I were person_118 I would be fucking frustrated about it. Bureaucracy
Is a bitch
Considering I am also enrolled in the class, I think it would happen to all users. It'd be nice if it were fixable, but I think attempting to control access based on classes is a bit ridiculous. If they're organization_18, give them access.
I thought that was the plan and don't know why it's not a thing yet
Guess it's time to get realistic haha
I mean it works just fine just the credentials part is always a bitch
Wouldn't know, never had renders that worked besides a scene with no textures/objects :)
I did a whitewater sim just fine and it took about 3 hours. It's way faster than any single machine so I'm super excited for the Houdini class people to have that
That's good. i'
I'm interested in testing it's performance, I have some files that could push it.
Only concern could be the night before an assignment people all render at the same time it might clog up
I don't think that'll be an issue for now, seems like the assignments are single renders until the final
Even then, that should be a group project. We'll see
But yeah I messaged that person so hopefully they'll have that whole thing figured out by tomorrow seeing as though students are actively waiting for it
That's sweet, excited to see that at the end
Thanks person_97! I'll definitely share my stuff if I can get higher quality renders going :D
i'll take you to all the good restaurants
Ugh all the ninjas are so cute. 
Uwahhh food. 
Love food
i reclassed person_179 to person_180's class aahah
and put bows in his hair

Yes
link_5
Pretty. I can post a review right now.  What's the payment for it?
i will send a promotion code to you
Crap. I don't have prime. Can you cover shipping?
yes
it wills end from amazon
That's fine if it ships from amazon. I just need a code that covers product + shipping to get me a 0.00 balance when I checkout
Aw I wish I didn't have to go
I love you
we've got lots of potatoes and carrots and beetroots now
Yum

I thought GG can only pick up auto abilities
Isn't his effect act
Oh shit misread it
Wait...
Doesn't that mean faterider is dead too?
And bind time

Bind time is a auto I think
But it's not feasible

Because there was no space
Class full and it got hot so prof opened the doors

For most it's a 3 way tie
person_128, person_127, and person_129
person_130
Tuition? Or loving included?
Living*
I have to fix this.
Total. Though a split up of how much living costs would be nice. :p
Well each semester, tuition is about 23k $
And monthly expenses varies between 500-800$ a month
Oh, how much is rent?
And typically, how much do people save?
My rent is 390pm
Save?
From their internships.
What is this savings you speak of? 
Summer internship savings.
Well if you get a good pay, and you're meagre in your expenses, about 15k is an optimistic amount
But this is very variable
Hmm
Depends on the pay, location, and whether there's corporate housing
And taxation
True.
Also, pointers for housing?
...
holy moly LOL
thats crazy
Yeah he kinda loves the game
organization_21 on level like 28
And he keeps saying if he didn't have kids he'd be over 30 already lolol

Eh cost premium for i7 seems a bit much
They're not??

:/ Well it doesn't advertise them as such anywhere on the product page whereas the flip explicitly says touchscreen
Right

They are on Amazon

What are you wearing to banquet

LOL
gg
No
Go away
round 3
ain't a rookie no more
going straight for that cheesecake
Lol take it from akl the other tables
physics project, making a motor work. We have a working motor but one of the wires snapped off a brush and we need to reattach it
I can get you an iron from robo, or could take it home myself to do
How big is it?
v small
like less than a quarter of your pinky nail
Wait the motor?
Are you making one yourself?
no no no
we took one out of a drill
the thing we need to solder is tiny
That was the size of the joint?
Ah OK I was asking about the motor
oh gotcha. It's a little smaller than my fist
When do you need it done / how comfortable are you with soldering?
as soon as possible but it isn't urgent. My groupmate had minimal experience so it'd be ideal if you could help us
Sounds like a quick job. Are you at school today?
yep
I'm not, but I'm coming at 3 for a robo thing. Could I get it from you then and do it tonight for you?
for sure
Haha are you serious
The girl told her to collect it from neville apt
Smart decision
But don't think she will
What. I want to punch!
Btw did the VO ever ask for ur tenth n twelfth border marksheet?
So you spend 140$? On that? Pointless.. So many better options. Punch her. For free
Dude the vo didn't ask me anything, no dividend
Documents
But keep it just in case. If you have it
70$ if we share
No harm
Major waste
Appointment tomorrow?
Take a copy
date_1 - date_2 month_1
Oh right.. 
But parents r angry saying What's wrong g with u Where's board marks all u care about is shopping blah blah movies blah blah
You have time. Search away
Hmmm
Worst case you'll have a copy I'm guessing.. Or you can get a duplicate from college and school, it's in location_31 anyway
Yeah I've soft copy
person_182 husband is moving to pwc in location_32 and she's quit n is moving there in April. Going to meet the nitk girls gang now
Now whatsapp update has introduced bold and italics and strike through in texts.

Congrats on getting into person_136 I was so so close to going there but got promoted and had to move
Yea I remember :), I'm in location_33 if you ever come back

Bought a house off of avenue_1

Well if you ever come back to visit let me know
This area and location_34 are going to jump in value like crazy
How are things going on your end?
Sold my house 3 years ago for 15% more than I bought it 2 years before that
Good , being a business owner has new challenges
Most of which I don't like to be honest
I like closing deals, hate dealing with HR issue, finance, etc but need to own all of it now
Also 0 stability like I'm used to with a big corporation
Also don't have as many resources
But is it sustainable in the right direction
you poked me first
you caught me by surprise
ahh so ur immediate reaction was to attack
remind me not to engage in physical contact with u LOL
hey better safe than sorry

Either that or when we get your case we can check
*the case
Its not urgent I just remembered that I had extra sleeves

Like almost enough for each person to basically open 2 boxes
Where are we opening this shit btw
