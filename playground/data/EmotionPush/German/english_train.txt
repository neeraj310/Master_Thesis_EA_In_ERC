Sorry to bother you but do you have the 270 textbook?
What's it called
Digital design and principles I think
I don't think so?
I could be wrong
Ok that's fine. I'm just trying hard to avoid paying for books
You don't need the boom
*book
If I do have it, I never used it
But you had a good professor
I mean you can use the notes
It tells you everything you need to know
That helped me more than person_0 tbh
Oh alright then. I really want to do well in this class because it's interesting to me
Like the lecture notes and the summary notes are so comprehensive and the exams are straight out of those
So idk if the book will help
Ok
Btw first exam is the same as first practice exam
Like 75% identical if not more
So if you get a 90%+ you should be in good shape cause the averages crash for the next 3 at a pretty steady rate
Wow
Everyone got hammered on the last exam last sem
Cause the no one knew wtf was going on for the second half of the exam
lmk when you get your server back up
if ever
or make a new one
We should institute a payment plan seeing as we have like 8 people using it now
why
does it cost you anything
yeah 20$ per month
ohhh
right now me person_353 person_1 and person_354 pay it
so are you paying for a broken server rn
what about person_346
but then theres person_346 person_355 and you
yeah exactly
lol
we'd also need to up the RAM with that many people probably which means more money per month
but yeah right now its broken because i explored too far but it works for person_354 and person_1....?
I'd chip in if you make a payment plan
Thank yo gracious sir
$20 eight ways is $2.50 a month
we gave person_355 a free trial but that time is up
person_165 is the money man though
person_353 plz fix the server plz
Oops (was working on art) /nOK. I'm on my way home
Oh cool
Walk to location_83?
I'll be there soon
Oh whoops 
I was walking to person_2

Yeah, I'll get off at location_84 from here
You're coming from location_85, right?

When I send that there's random hearts flying
Yes exactly
Hearts flying
For u
All the way from bharat
Not when I click on yours though
Ok then it happens s without clicking is it
Doesn't it fly on yours with my emoji?
Muchos gracias
No nothing happens with yours
Only the sender can see it
Oh
I thought person_3 said it flew on hers as well yday when I sent her my love
Maybe your love for me doesn't fly
Hurtful
I sent the payment earlier not sure who it went to though
I got it
My paypal is kinda jank
Bout to say it had a different name
Yeah don't worry about it
It was person_4 troller
Right?

He's going to get the mvp award sometime next round too
not just a fan
yeaaa
But he'll be on the bench
I've never seen it happen
well it has been a season for the ages
in terms of records broken and everything
Meanwhile all these other fans are happy he's hurt smh

especially cuz how little i padi attention in class this weke
week
hahahah dude same..
alright well let's just keep each otehr updated~
yeah forsure
LOL 
Did you put it in anyways 
I always put it in ;) 
Not really I couldn't find an opportunity 
That test was boring 
Was it supposed to be exciting 
Yes
You were supposed to kiss me
You were too far away 
Too much we got 
Effort
Sorry not worth I guess 
u missed out
dont worry
we'll see each other again
ill offer u another opportunity
We only have 7 days before the end of classes 
The window is closing 
we're college students
procrastination is what we do
im an expert
just gotta find the right time, a nice private location with good vibes LOL
You can't procrostinate on this!!! It has to be special </3
And it'll be special because it was procrastinated on! <3
lmao actually elections are tomorrow
im good to start working now
Oh loll
Is it ok if I meet you in like 30 min?
yea forsure, where do you wanna work?
Wanna go UC basement?
sure hahahah that works for me
im i the uc
Hahaa word
yeah I actually work for the organization_0
so at one of my clients, they moved all the data (comign from all these different 3rd party vendors) into one centralized data warehouse, and then I collected requirements for reports and then developed them
Hmm and you go on site to do those things
the reports would be used by the sales reps (it's a pharma company) hwen they're on the field, to have information they need immediately, when they're trying to sell products to doctors/clinics/hospitals/etc.
yeah
Oh okay gotcha, so is there programming involved with the data analysis
yes but not necessarily like location_0 and stuff
we do hire Java programmers and other programmers
most of what I do, I work with ETL developers who are skilled in tools like organization_1,e tc.
what are you interested in?
Ok gotcha, do you enjoy it?
I'm just keeping in touch with my best frand
lol sure
yeah I do
Do you and person_6 work in the same department?
especially now that I know what I'm doing and I've been given a lot of responsibility, I like it
no, he's in organization_78
he is trained in organization_79 and works on projects where he is implementing it and troubleshooting
Yeah that makes sense
Oh okay so what other things go on there? Are there any internal projects or just clients?
Okay is there a main location?
we have internal work too but I'm not as familiar with it
technically the location_1 HQ is in location_2 but our major offices are NYC, location_3, organization_2, location_4, location_5, location_6 (burbank) and location_7
organization_3 global HQ is in location_8
Well apparently I am one bus late
Rip
You're fine my grandmas late to everything
:/
I hate taking a bus only to location_9 but it's just slightly faster than walking
Wait included
Are we doing something afterwards?
Idk
I'm on my way to a baseball game actually
How long will that be? I want to see you but it's okay if we wait til Monday
The game is far away. Starts at 2pm I won't be home till 5 or 6
We just found out about the game 20 min ago
This bus stop is next to a soccer field and there's a kid using an orange cone as a megaphone
Ok
That's fine
Text me when you're back home
And I'll let you know where I am
Okay <3
I didn't say mid may
OH
lol ok
thats good to know
anyw your rent for next year will be 500/month k
our landlord increase our total rent of the house
or else will be cheaper
ok
increase how much?
$150/month
ok
is person_382 going to move in?
he hasnt confirmed yet
if he doesnt, we need to find another person
yea maybe lol
the person only needs to pay 250
That save him/her and us alot
yup
Unclear how to take this deep ebony
But i picked up a squirrel today
So you have rabies now
Wasn't a question just a statement
I think I've probably always had rabies
Deep ebony, sounds like a porn movie
Oooh u right
link_0
Everytime I click one of your links I think oh no what did I just do
link_1
Good good my particular brand of surprise
An art
I don't start drama, do you?
I don't usually but if I did
Actually I try to mostly avoid people
And so I can play with myself?
No you can play with person_7
Fine you can play with me
That's more repaid it's
Realistic *
You can lick Nutella off person_8's booty
If he's still alive haha
Last time I talked to him was when I was in location_10 lab a couple semesters ago and we used a  Buchner funnel and it reminded me of organization_4 chem
He responded to you?
Yeah we talked for a little bit
He said he was animating for free until he started getting paid
Things now?
No things
Give me a few minutes. I'm in the middle of a game
??
Game?
Though person_9 is playing, so it might be a couple hours
We're halfway through a thing if Smash Up
So like an hour
Or two
I'd say 20ish minutes
I'll let you know
Then I'll come over
thanks for the cupcakes :*
yw ^_^ and gl on your finals!!!!!
yeah you too <3
how many finals do you have?
none but i have like 4-5 projects LOOOOL
well atleast i dont have to study
):
awww well you got this (y)
that is a lot of projects tho...
would you rather have tests than projecs?
Scary for one. The world just seems to big right now. In location_11, and feel weird since I can't just walk to everywhere.
but overall pretty excited for the future. Good things are in store.:-)
That's nice to know ! Cali is so beautiful! Enjoy Every bit of it ! Haha, pretty sure you don't miss your second home, person_10 :P
I do actually.😅 It was my safe haven as well. Now I've been trying to print something since morning. No success yet. Don't know where to go/look.
Haha
#realworldtroubles
Adulting at its finest. When faced with a problem, sit on the bed and do nothing, while having tea and perusing social media.
shit can wait 😬
Haha nice. Enjoy enjoy
Thanks. You too.
Stay in contact.
I've seen people come and people go from organization_5

Waves and generations of people haha
LOL. YOURE LIKE person_11
lunch I eat a lot
But then I have too many snacks in the afternoon
Then for dinner I wat cereal sometimes lol

sadly, based on this
i will draw the conclusion that your digestion is pretty bad? lol
Yup
You got it 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Unhealthy char
we both fall in the same category then haha
get bloated easily, and feel full for hours on end
sucks
YESSSS
Finally someone understands me haha
I hate feeling bloated
I even get it when I drink water
Like just a couple of sips
one interesting thing i've found out
DRINK WARM WATER
i quit drinking cold water
and the bloating from drinking water has disappeared
So I just saw person_12's Blue-Eyes list since he just posted it in location_12, omfg it hurts. @_@

Ahh wrong
Unfortunately, having witnessed the event live, I can confirm that I was hard
Lmaooooooooo shitttt a
person_17
Wtf happened 
I also can't say this is the first time I've witnessed this live
And the other time alcohol wasn't even involved
Lol
Lolll 
person_18
How does this even happen
Lol
Am I scaring you off from visiting me at home next year
I think it will happen
But yeah that would be nice
Yeah, probably do you know who's coming?
person_19 paak
Possibly some lady named person_20
She leaked it woops
And idk
Lol how dare person_21 do that
I don't know any of those people but whatevers
I don't think she knew it was supposed to be secret
She put it on her schedule or something
Me neither but I listened to person_19 paak and he's pretty good
What kind of music is it?
I'll check them all out, so I am prepared
Rap I guess?
I'm not good at genres
Could one dance to it?
You can dance to anything if you believe
Wow! That is so inspirational, did you just make that up?
That is true
Its up to you if you want to join in
But ill try to get my shit together and start one soon
Well lemme know what all you need from me (money or otherwise) and I'll let you know.
I mean unless you want to be part of the split, the people in it should pay for itself
If you want GP or something thats a different story
I'd rather not really invest into any of the clans, since like, Royals I don't really care for shit, Neo Nectar will be cheap anyways so I'd go neg on a split, and I only want 1 card for Golds.
GP is probably one of the cheapest clans in the split tho
I mean depends, cause again I only really want a playset of the OP OP stride
The red one has been taken. The blue one is still available.
What
We said both for 65
Conditional of me picking up Tuesday
Sorry. First person in the door with the money gets it.
You should have said that
I woulda had one of my friends come by over the weekend
My apologies. I get many such messages from people who eventually end up bailing.
I'll do 30 and pick up by tomorrow
Oh
We lost to nyu
How are your games today going

Shindig??

Nice
Yeah person_28 k has 12 essays,4 assignments and 7 exams to study for.. Sure../nMore like 12 photoshoots, 4 nude selfies and 7 sex tapes to make
It's good to be young in the batch.. When you're one of the oldest ones, and you get stuck on something that someone else has figured out, that's when you feel stupid
Interesting, son must be partying
More than one word. Take it and go
Thaaanks
Now tell me how much does a jar of 320Gm Nutella cost in $$
And not all one year olds party like u
Pity. That's a ripe age to hit the clubs. Never too early
And it's around 4$
ask person_413 how she would spend $66.59 on amazon
:p
(i know, i'll spent it on school supplies)
"Clothes or dorm stuff"
(i'm just thinking about fun things)
pls
That's what she said!
that's no fun
lol
Clothes and dorm stuff is so much fun
i guess
Personally
yeah i'd like to buy some clothes
I don't like clothes shopping on us
?
Online lol
ah
i'll buy things I know fit already
like i'd get more levis, bc i already know my size with them
Mhm
there's a lot more variation in girls' stuff too
That's true
It's up to you
I understand
I know
I think we should
There's no way whatever we do adds up to a prom ticket   tux rental in price, anyway :p
so ok
Okay
so far we have: price shouldn't be an obstacle (up to a reasonable point, anyway)
what do we want to do?
nice restaurant?
(probably)
if so, how nice?
I liked mon ami ga I
person_29
okay
That's in location_14 park
where is it?
(y)
organization_13 and the lake
not bad

haha ok should catch up; i'm about to run to Russian class so let's talk later
ooh nice
take care

Last chance to see person_30 perform before he joins the military
record it for me
person_31 that's it
How's yours going?
Lol
I think I fucked up pretty big
Oh noo why
Cause person_32 (x,y)
Is weird
Like when you want a(x,y) I get a(y,x)
Oh hahah yeah I always do (j,i) in matlab for my indices
person_33
Yup... So I gotta fix that
Need to determine what exactly gets chsnged
But I have functions for nearly everything else
Do you average the residuals for each iteration? Or sum them?
It's the norm of the residual
The eqn is in the book. It's a sum
Oh at each iteration no, you recalculate the residual based
On that iteration
Oh I see I see
Yeah I think I'll just stick a res_tot term in there
And plug it into the sum thing at the end of each iteration
How you iz?
I'm walking home but I can get it for you probably
Okay thanks
I installed something but now it's giving me this
Yea get rid of that and just wait
Wow organization_14 sends jars
yeah facebook sends everything
No, not executable files
and pornhub links
Really?
Let me know if that fixes it
Review session at 7:30!!!
when?
what
For cog psych
isn't our test tomorrow
For the test tomorrow
Yes
7:30
As in last night
oh
shit
i didn't go
lol
I know lol
do you have notes
I wasn't there for most of it
It wasn't really helpful to me Bc most of the questions were on stuff I learned last semester
Like about logic and stuff
so no notes?
i'll send u what i wrote down but it wasn't much
okay
do you have notes for our last class
Yes
But the energy is on all bars right
the yellow part
Yeah because the ones in the bottom are the numbers dialed
We are interested in the lower frequencies ie higher scale
Exactly, i don't see any yellow in the higher scales. So I guess I'll have to change the scales to make it narrower
Yeah
Cool
http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2016/04/14/a-good-name-points-to-you/#more-5424

Yeaa didnt eat dinner cos of the deadline lol 
I should probably just go down, might be less stuck after i got food 
Is that supposed to be you
lol i just  randomly chose something for the character creation
I mean as long as we walk away with something I'd say we're ok
You just got me killed on my phone game :/
But yeah you right, although I need to make a small investment in order to buy the case
Cause one guy is doing split payment and that puts us short 30 bucks
Unless PM get bought
I'll post another PM announcement this weekend.
The guy who bought NN is interested in PM so hopefully I can work something out with him
Even though my announcement-oh nice
Also mfw with all the stuff I sold person_35 I can buy that location_18 supply set and still have a good chunk of money left over.
Lol wat
What're you doing rn?
Making tea
There's a whole shelf full that I never noticed
I hope it's not caffeinated
Or at least didn't remember being this full
Nope
Throat coat :p
This is a pretty deep cabinet
Why do they need so much tea?
Lol
My mom has lots of tea too
Anyway I'm gonna wait 10m for it to steep and then go upstairs
Ok
I want to be with you
I know
I want to fall asleep with you
I'm so tired
So badly
bored
Me too
Take a shot
no
take a sip of coke
Lol
Eat a bubble from your bubble tea
i dont have bubble tea
Eat a bubble from person_36's bubble tea
she went to location-HL
Lol why
for a event-HL
Ohh okay
Well since you're fishing for love
I forgot to rest at it, I only lit it
So I gotta do it again
oooh noo
Well getting to it isnt the worst
It's the getting out which sucks
around location-HL
But it made it super atmospheric
10/10
Isn't there a way to firelink from it?
And yeah it lags for me too
I dont think so
If you have a stream up, I can help
I have a feeling it would be better if we don't include the card, but then hinge a pendulum on the floating magnet
In essence, it's the same concept u came up with, but a cleaner implementation
like an inv pend on a magnet tat is levitated?
*cart
person_37
You got itv
then how will we move it in x direction?
for control ?
Ahhhhhhh no we can't
can u like come up with a actual set up sometime so that modellig can be done
Yeah I can do that
ok
Also
Do u think we can use a normal magnet ?
I am thinking as to how can we detect if the stick is vertically up or down ????
When those people came to give demo that day, do u remember we asked them how they detected if the stick was vertical
maybe a marker at one point in the stick and at one point in the bob
and some detectr of them
Hmmmm
Let me think of some more ideas and get back
yea d
person_38
I'm here, sorry
Didn't see that you messaged
sorry about that
person_380 is now off to ballet!
oh!
goodbye person_380
that episode was kinda crazy though
yeah right?
for real
I think we're still in the other call if you wanna talk there
where, i can't find it
call me pls
O.410
zkldjflKSDAJas
i have 0.0436
and nat has about 0.03
T_T
I checked with people who finished and got the correct answer
First iteration should be 0.410
Then around 0.07 after
ughhh
there's only one row with 0.41 though right?
Oh you've never used it before location_6?
Didn't really use it much at location-HLfor meetups either
Also Outfits? Are you a fashion king now?
When did you stop ldr?
Like 2 months agoish?
And more want to look better. I have a lot of casual young looking clothes that aren't very adult 
Oh with that girl from Northwestern?
Yup
We can talk about it another time. But I'm not in a mood to talk about the ldr stuff right now lol
Oh so like suits and vests?I am also getting rid of some clothes soon too for an upgrade Ebony style
Yeah of course no prob
Like more button downs and half zips
Half zips?
Idk. Bringing a fashionable girl to help lol
Oh I''m coming?
Only if i was shopping for booty shorts
I wear other clothes, also I haven't even worn them in location_13 yer
*yet
just got this from person_39; idk if you guys did
Yep, I did
I hope you're happy now person_40
I am. I really am
I didn't even know you could have a golden quiet. that's just kind of a bonus
You can apparently have a golden self
holy shit. I'm only seeing a golden arm there but I guess there's always room to improve
Is this what person_41 would have wanted
person_41 wanted quiet to breathe through her skin dude
How can she do that if she's made of gold
i think the mythbusters tested that once actually
person_42 used to do his research
Now what
Lol I'm a coffee cup
yupp
Lol I like the Pusheen sticker because it looks like he's trying to figure out the ball of yarn like it's a Rubik's Cube or something, I like to imagine you lying there struggling to figure out your laptop lol
i dont need to figure out my laptop
i have it figured inside out lol
Then why are the eyebrows like that
cos i need to concentrate on playing vid games
They're definitely making out behind that heart
:O
Lol
Still my favorite
Ooh you can tap on a sticker and it'll send you to the set that it's from 
yeaa
im using laptop so cant do that
Oh wait
Does that stand for be right there
oohhhhhh
yraa
what date are u coming back?
I don't know
I might be driving a U-Haul down because my parents want to throw out a bunch of my furniture but it costs money to throw out furniture so it would be of comparable cost for me to rent a U-Haul and drive it down there
But we'll see
did you see the dog gif i sent you
The dog fighting for bone?
Owner stole his bone
he was sad because the person was holding the bone and making nomming motions
doge wanted bone back
Yeah
it was very frustrated doge
That was doggo's bone
yes
Gonna meet up with my mom
today?
Yes
She spontaneously want to visit
from philly?
where she staying?
A hotel
interesting
She said bc my dad is in location_19, I want to come visit you
So maybe she lonely
aw poor mommy
She has my bro tho
hey person_459 would you take a quick look over this doc?  i'm not sure how our values of b and n compare to the other groups'
At the gym rn, but I'll take a look as soon as I get home
cool
Thanks for putting everything in sheets
no prob
did you get the math before we left?
i took a photo of my notes
I have the two important equations written down
it just wasn't clicking for me in physics but it's pretty straightforward
i just followed along through the lab sheet again
relevant stuff is in pen
other things are like multi notes or idk
That makes sense to me
cool
yeah there's just something about the physics room that destroys my ability to concentrate
msg me when you've found time to look at it and I'll email him (or you can)
Will do
(y)
maybe i'll just message the chat asking for tickets LOL
Lol that's awks. ......we had to wake up at 5 for them bro
person_445 still hasn't replied I'm freaking out every time I get an email
lol i wast just kidding
its the weekend meh
He emailed me this morning lol
Do professors even have lives
His family isn't even here lol I doubt he's like going out
I live a long ways from location_20! Seen where on messenger.
We sell online and ship anywhere
I'm sorry. I was being a little  bit of a pervert.
OK...um are you looking for a vacuum?
This is a big misunderstanding
Okay. So I guess no vacuum
Nope. I have tile floor.
We sell mops
Na I think I'm getting  outta here. We can still b friends. Up to u.
The new food place in location_21 is open
Pics
person_43 got fancy af
What does it have to offer
These buzz when your food is ready
These are the noodles person_44 got
Woah
It's a Culinart place
Is anyone there?
Yeah there's people there
To get there you go to the entrance of location_88 and then go into that little glass building to the left and go down the stairs
Also when person_45 will be complete, it will be possible to go to person_46, location_22, person_47, person_48, person_49, location_88, person_50, person_51, and Gates without stepping outside
my life will be complete
ill live in the steam tunnels
Unless you ever have to go to location_23
*Scaife
(My dads talking to my uncle so it's paused rn)
(y)
my head hurts
i drank a ton of water today though
Aw bb I'm sorry
idk
i'll put on pants and go get water soon
Goals
:p
also i'm not using the right distro for this server at all
i had a regular ubuntu USB stick but i should have used ubuntu server
i can't wait until i have a real internet connection
Do it at my house
when I finally finish setting this thing up and give it to you'll want to ask your dad about port forwarding
Haha okay
I love you movies starting ttyl
Bye <3
I love you
I don't understand what was the point of doing zidd!
You put me in such a position in front of others
It's not the first time
Gn
It was not about being ziddi I told you I wanted to talk to you before I slept you said hmmm
Yeah I regret telling you that
I asked you I could stay up
I was not forcing you to talk
No that did not happen
But yeah you are clearly not interested
Why would I lie person_52
You said that you are going to sleep and you were hoping to talk before then
Can't you just not put me in such situations in front of people
Like really please
I never put you in any position :(
I asked you got long you would take I could wait up
Lol and I thought that was romantic
I'm sorry ya
But good to know what my call means to you
And I'm sorry if this hurts you but I'm getting little tired of your disinterest in me
Even if you are not disinterested you are making me feel like that
Bombed the exam-HL
Might finally have an exam score to rival that 30% I got on exam-HL
Nice
My friend person_495
So the curve will be good?
 Maybe baby
maybe baby
Do you think I should send a follow up email or is that pushing it?
Nah you have to be proactive
So what do I say?
Do it
Idk
I was just wondering about the status of my application
I'm really interested in working here because 
I think my skills (list a few examples) are perfect for this job so I wojld love to hear back from you
link_3
i want the complete set
and then i can put them in a row on our bed
hehe
omg
ur the lamest of the lamest of the lamest of the lames
but actually
complete set pls
as u wish my love
are you sure
Yeah
How tall are you?
i am 5 feet and 3/4 inch.
Oh
But right you're barely over 5 feet 
..ok
you are not 1'15:
That's impossible
15 inches would not work
2 feet 3 inches
But I was not born on February 3rd 
oh i see you smart
Yeah see
What kind of things does person_362 like for birthdays
oh no
oh wait omg i don't want that
i was just linking you
i like a lot of things
there's literally so many things lmao
person_53 wants a die thru
NO
So tell me love, how do I get into this sever
my IP is 99.140.177.174
so you can just paste that into "direct connect"
don't bother adding it since i'll bring it over tomorrow
Versus adding a server?
Okay
tell me if it doesn't work
Failed to connect
Lemme restart game-HL tho
rip

i'll disconnect and try myself through a VPN
Ok
Brb helping w the dishwasher

Yes I love birds
birdie 2016
box underneath bed slips out from underneath bed
What
idk she likes to know what i recieve
Did you get a box? 
I would like to know what you received too
no i didn't
it was an old box
Oh boo
Poor disappointed person_489
why what do you think i got
oh
He's insane
He weighs 120
That doesn't make sense
He eats like 120lbs every meal
weight = 120. meal = 120. weight += meal. . assert(weight == 120)
It doesn't work
He ate 182 slices of bacon in 5 minutes
That's like
person_485 I don't wanna do math
But that's a lot every minute
Did I tell you about my friend who are an entire organization_15 packet when high
Yes
That's the dream
Don't take os so I can just 420 and eat bacon?
Ooh much needed correction very smooth
I am smooth as ice
But ice melts
Yeah but water is smooth to
I disagree
It was a whole year thank you
But rivers and oceans be choppy
Those are made of water but are not water themselves
I have a lab report due at 5pm
might as well get it out of the way
I'm not the only on in the cluster rn, there's some concepts studying going on here too
Lolol damn
organization_16 well person_54 pass the fuck out
Good night man good luck with ur report
See u tmrw for the movie
See ya
for an IS class
its okay no one comes to office hours
Lololol
Thats hilariousss
No one comes to mine either
its all good cause then you can do work
or sleep
Lol i just sit on my phone
And wonder why im there
person_55
hmmmm
Sorry I was thinking about it.
Would it be nice to giving her a chance to take an interview?
im fine with it
i granted her access to it alr actually
did you send her the link to the spreadsheet?
cos shes not in the email list
No I didn't
but there were no rules that people who didn't send the email couldn't attend the interview-HL
huh maybe she was on the email list?
yup as in im curious how she got the link
haha
So I think granting her access is a good choice
yup
person_56 me too
Let's have an interview with her
i think she'll be a good TA haha
super patient
yeah haha
well IT implementation consulting for tax/benefits haha
he's like the team lead
then there's like a project manager
then partner
superflat orga
*org
then yea salary makes sense
he probably gets bonuses as well
and this is what i was goign og to say
its not the money that matters
its the relative value determined by salary that will start to jab @ u
you can still spin to being
i make more *you*
b/c a.) i live in troy and cheap it up so i save more
b.) i scumbag so i get way more per hr and am not doing much
but --> @ the end of the day one makes 2x you other 1.75 x
yeee
it's a jab alright haha
it's like I have to work two jobs to compete lol
or u know -- find someting to change your career trajectory
and its not like those 2 are going to stop making /increasing their salaries
I'm only back for a couple of days before going on vacation with family
oh true
and then you're dippin'
To
Yup
I'll be beck for June tho
idk i just want to get lunch or s/t
perhaps it'll be my treat
perhaps not
person_57
suspense
Suspense 
But yeah lunch or brunch c: would be nice
probably brunch
because things to do
I know of this place on location_24. A  waffles.
person_468
person_469*
your name is so generic
that I can't freaking tag you in the post on the page
person_58?
yea
Is this on fb
Can't you just type my name without the @
it's a page though
do you even have the page liked? :P
it worked just fine on my computer
this is mysterious
Hm
Send him the file again?
1.8, installed to default location, downloaded the file i sent
Maybe it got corrupted
yeah maybe it
^
i'll email him tomorrow
i'm p sick -_-
Yeah
It's late
Go to bed
oh boy
?
min is also that
you are using system-HL(1)?
umm i installed mingw
what is your gcc -V
no i dont think im usign msys2
Thread model: posix/ngcc version 5.3.0 (x86_64-posix-seh-rev0, Built by MinGW-W64 project)
ooooo
they say to use system-HL(2)
oh umm ill see how i can downgrade this
i must have missed it
under the building on windows section
:/
that is to build rust though
i'm sure you need a compatible abi when building c libs that rust needs to link with
i havent installed any msys2
do you think that woldb required?
No. I think just the different version of gcc may be the problem
ok il try that
Also, we gotta start on the vlogs and shit
Wanna go hard on that tomorrow as well or do you have a lot to do?
I have a decent amount to do so depending on how the day goes I can probably do stuff later on
Okay cool. I just need you for a few pics then you can go back to work. I'll start on the houdini stuff at some point tomorrow anyway.
Yeah I gotta do Houdini stuff too lol
if you wanna do that at the same time as me it'll probably benefit you too haha
That's not a bad idea haha
damn son
Sup
I feel as if the amount of things to do is pretty low in location-HL haha
and it's probably one of the biggest reasons why I still play magic haha
:(
Just hungout with the data analytics folk watching football eating pizza
Lol
hahaha

Enjoyable, good to know those second years

Well you can canoe on the person_62 
But in the past I've only canoed on the location_26
We used to do trips in high school where we would canoe to a campsite, spend the night there, canoe to the next campsite, spend the night there, and then canoe to a pickup point
sounds funn
It was
I actually went last year too
Even though I graduated lol
went with the ppl in your highschool?
lol
It's a joy. But you're a small white British woman so they'll be better to you
Probably not. To be fair I fly quite often and haven't either
I always seem to get frisked =)
So annoying
In the location_27? They have dumb as shit security laws, too?
Oh yeah
Ain't it grand?
So you're coming in June?
I am indeed
The time-HL(1) to be exact
I'll be gone for like a month already by then but in late August I'll be back
Ahh fair enough, my camp end date is time-HL(2) so I can go any time after then
You should definitely travel, stay in the north though
Yeah I can't afford to travel round loads, I'd probably stay until mid time-HL(3) latest because I start uni at the end and I want to be back home for a week or so before I go
Gotcha ~ well I have a studio with a spare bed and my girlfriend has a couch if you need a place to stay for a bit
Oooh I shall let you know!

Sell stuff
Probably a lot of other things on my to-do list
It's too late to think about it
Yeah don't start now
Hey you
<<3
oops
I love you
And I love you
I've been thinking about you for hours
There's so many things I want to do with you
<3
We need to do more than sit at home I think
i think so too
I want to experience the world with you
and I want to sit and watch the sunset, at the end of the day
we're going to have a great time
With you, of course I will
Oh I got some of them pretty much the same
Some of them close
ok nvm i got the last two right
it was just the ch 8 questions
Oh the buckling ones?
Yeah those were weird haha
yeah
v is constant that relates axial to transverse strain
How do you derive it?
good question
In all his examples it's just given haha
I just worked backwards on the first answer to get it and used that v for the rest and it was fine
so you never found a way to get v?
oh its in the material properties table
Oh really?
yeah
Lol
Dropped Spanish to take 490 lol
good man
You couldn't have moved it to a later slot?
too many credit hours to deal

Hey person_70, I'm in hunt
Oh shoot I'm so sorry!!! T^T I forgot to put our meeting in my calendar....... D:
Ahhhhhh
Ah it's ok, do you have time now? Or should we reschedule
Uhh I'm not on campus :/ so I feel like we won't have a lot of time to meet. Could u meet tomorrow at 2pm?
Hmmm
Yea
Ok
Hunt?
We could meet off campus if ur not going to be at school!
It doesn't matter
I have to be on campus for an event at time-HL so either way is fine
fucking hell. Now that that's done, I can actually leave the house
Wooo
I still don't know my grades
Yea, I've waited the last week
so bring one controller?
Have you still not left?
Will we want to do 3 person smash?
no. And no
So then don't bring one and leave now
im looking for ds
dad put it somewhere when it was brought in last night
I am not being able to login. I don't know why.
maybe u need to call organization_86?
am preparing an excel sheet
with all charges
Also last time I logged in I couldn't see my bill
It was only showing total bill
can u call them and clarify please?
OK.
I am calling them
i've sent the detailed bill on the group
:)
also, they wont be able to call me right now
because i broke my phone and dont have a phone

after the post, i was using a temp phone until my new one arrived,
i broke that too.
Oh god
Worst enemy of mobile phones

Mfw team-HL are getting shat on
ARG?
YGO?
YGO
Lol
Like people saw the Hero list that got 6th and legit were just shitting on everyone that went there and saying it was the most free regional ever.
Wut
Yeah
Like the Hero list looked really solid too
Wait wat
Yeah, like I wouldn't call it a shit list
link_5
No stratos... it's bad
Shit tier list
Literally worse than hitler
omfg
Haha
person_71 change kiya
Got lazy
It's a lot of work
Ask person_409 he changed it
I tried but I broke a connection from inside
There are tutorials online on YouTube
So do it at your own risk

Hey bub
Just got back from a walk with mom and location_28 
that's cute... how are they?
They're doing well
location_28 is really big!
how big is really big?
Like 70 lbs!!
wow yikes
Lol
Can't, unless it's your last semester
perfect
trying to do tha tlol
that*
are there any other things you cant do as part time
I'll letchu know this time next year
Probably stay past midnight on campus
Cause I won't be doing person_72 shit :3
god damn haha
That was amazing
Are you still up?
Hey you
Yeah
Sleepy though
I wish you could see the smile that just broke across my face
I'm not gonna be home for another 30 probs
<3
I'll putter around for a bit
You sure?
yeah
You can go to bed
i'm downstairs and reasonably awake
my family just watched a movie
idk what
Ok
Update: average on the exam-HL was a score-HL(1) and i got score-HL(2)
=}
person_73
Hopefully that curves
Nah der orgofuhrer doesn't curve at all
Yikes, at least you're doing better than average then
But i got the points i needed to pass and then some (like an extra 10 percent) so I'm happy
That's all that matters my dude
Yeah half the people enrolled in course-HL i drop it by the end of the semester
Got a 65 on my coding final, needed 52 to pass
Cs get degrees
Cs gradus udibus
Or whatever the fuck
On a fucking plaque
Yessss
Make person_74 again
OH person_75
DO IT
I'm thinking if i wanna transfer the data from my old 3ds to this new one
Thing is person-HL(1) is borrowing my old 3ds to play fates cuz person_458 is borrowing hers lmao
Right. Wait what
Why is person_458 borrowing hers?
If you want to
You can decide it's too much
Ok I'm using another person_76 add on for images
I'll see if I have time this weekend. :D My focus will be on our report and hand-off documents
those add-ons seem to be saving us
ok
can someone tell me how file uploading is implemented
I cannot find ANYWHERE where the files are handled
Well the upload images field is implemented in location_29 and uses Pillow to do something
aside from that, I'm not sure
ok I go tit
got it
looks cool
also haven't seen one good review for no mans sky hah
yeah I don't really like it after watching a lot of gameplay
i had the feeling before it came out. never bought into the hype
especially when they said it was 8 gb
what's up with your rating of sausage party? I heard good comedy in it
i walked out after like 40 minutes. Both me and person_77 laughed like two times at puns and that was it. I just felt like it was trying wayyyyyyyy too hard to be dirty and sexual and it made every cuss word and sex joke come out forced. Ill probably watch it again while drunk and maybe I'll like it and finish it hah. Sucks cause I was really excited for it and I love person_78 movies. But the first half hour just seemed like one joke stretched far too long hah.
dang I still wanna see it to try it but I see what you're saying
I love person_79 as a voice and acting but I'm not too fond of his improv comedy
I mean I'm in the minority cause its getting good reviews. So idk I may see it again and have a few drinks and see it with different people. Cause person_77 usually doesnt like person_78 so that could have rubbed off on me. And yeah like I loved the interview and this is the end and pineapple express. I've never seen his improv.
Hey u have the lease right?
Mhmm
r u at home by any chanceee
Nope
What's up
okk uh do u know if it says somewhere on the lease about how much the water bill is?...
like if it's a set amount
Uhhh I don't rmb
I think it's included in rent??
I'll check when I get home
ya i know that hahha
i was just wondering if the amount was stated anywhere
r u in studio?
Have a baby camel to cheer up
<3
So I can go wherever today, if you don't want to do something in just gonna go home and do that scholarship and play game-HL:p
It looks like I'm going to be up by evanston in about 2-3h
so idk if that works
i should do that scholarship too though
I could probably meet you up the then-ish
Where exactly will you be?
i'll do scholarship stuff on the way
So I can b e there between time-HL(1) if you wanted to meet up there
is there anything to do up there?
Idk but we could just go back into the city together
nah I don't want to make you go all the way somewhere just to go back
I want to
where would we go?
I don't know
It doesn't matter to me
I love you
So when will you be there?
i'm gonna get a shower before I leave I think
Okay
I'll text you when I leave home and when I get on the bus to person_80's
Okie dokie
We're leaving location-HL around time-HL(2) and it's like an hour away from here
hey so package may be arriving today
but anyway i'm leaving tomorrow at time-HL so we need to meet tonight or tomorrow
if package does arrive today, then we can meet with person_460 and you can get your contacts
if not it'll just be money transaction
(y) I work on campus from 7-9?
we can do before?
okay
just in case does after work as well?
yes
after work work
okay I'm gonna stop now
oh my god

person_475, when is the paper due
time-HL(1) or time-HL(2)
It's due at 11:59 tonight
praise the sun
praise the scotty dogs
That's what I said what I found out
do your guns have any battery left
Id like to shoot myself
If they did, I would have done so myself ages ago
:/
I'll let you know tmro
ok
if not, we'll still meet tuesday
Totally
Hey is this message weird to send:
Hey person_81. This is kinda out of the blue, but I just wanted to say I really enjoyed working with you this year. For someone who clearly knows a lot more than me, you were really great about explaining things, and never condescending. I really appreciate it. Oh and congrats on graduating!
a little
like, just say the good stuff and congratulate him on his graduation
it'll be appreciated
well idk actually
you don't want it to feel like he has to tell you that you know things too, etc etc
Hey person_81. I just wanted to say I really enjoyed working with you this year. You were always really great about explaining things, and never condescending. I really appreciated it. Oh and congrats on graduating!
True
Sounds good
but it's not weird or anything
that's a personal thing
nice message
you're a very thoughtful person
I messed up the left flames 
WIP 
Woah what? 
Woah the tree
Meh it's alright
Oh
person_389 extended the deadline, as predicted
I am done caring about this project 
Also person_390 really doesn't like me
I asked if I could get a crayon for the kid's house and she rather sternly told me to work with the materials I haf
*d
Rip
She didn't like me either
But that's cuz I was a freshman and she loves seniors
What's your excuse :p
I quit 
I just have to do the cover I think 
Did you paint all the people?
Yeah
Nice
Hey Stanford girl! All the very best for your journey! :)
Hey person-HL(1)! Thank you so much!
:D How is it there ? Must be great!
Yeah it's really nice! Been just 2 days since I landed here. So I am still trying to figure out things and exploring! 😅
Ohhhh! I thought u left for the location_1 a long time back?
Wowow..enjoy :D
Thank you!
I did just 2 days ago. Classes start pretty late here compared to centre and east coast. So mine is starting next week!
Ahhh okay okay!
How did your RA/TA hunt go?
And which course ????
degree-HL in course-HL
Just started the hunt 😅
Profs expect you to have done at least a quarter here b4 they take you
Ohhhhh
But anyways I am trying to mail as many as possible. I had been lazy during the vacations though :P
Haha great great! All the best for that! U'll get it :D
So do u have to decide the domain now ?
Like what you would be focussing on during the course of your masters ?
Yes I have to. I am trying to figure that out. Thinking between organization_18 and systems-HL
lol we got her good
i probably fucked it up a bit
but shes confused
im confused
so she must be confused
LOL
yeah thats the real goal here
we're but mere pawns in the grand scheme of  just making her really confused
HAHA
yesss
are you going to try to improve your test/skill/score-HL
That's what I'm doing now
oh ok
nicee
So far the only thing I've achieved is submitting the same thing again and getting a lower score
yeah dude
all depends on the load
I submitted it again
It went down one more point
Also should I buy this
The song
That hoodie
Cause as you know, Im an endless legend
I mean if u want it would be cool and like if u can convince every one who is going to regional with us to wear one then Yea otherwise you do u
Wait im gonna convince everyone to wear a hoodie with my name on it wut
Yea #organization_90
O.o wut
If I dont top, then that shit is embarrassing
I mean I don't think that's a problem for u
person_82 wants to do it wtf
#organization_90
Wtf
Look up the image on FB and tell me how much the hoodie costs lol
*Google
I mean  you can tell its my email
At least the person_472 part
Yea I just lol'd
I swear to god I was 13 when I made that account and I couldnt change the name
The paypal???
Yeah
The account is old AF
person_83 did you have your own credit card and everything rofl
I had a bank account
And you were trading then??
I used it for location_30 and ebay
Not for card games
lol kk makes sense now
But like.. a 13 year old selling on ebay is weird
Dam businessman at the age of 13
YGO
Old stuff I wanted to get rid of
what were you selling?
Its ebay lol
hey person_84's is the place with the extra good food yeah?
nothing has extra good food
dude asheesh
organization_74 has that big burger with fries out the ass yeah?
I guess, honestly not sure
ok, cuz i went there few months back after base camp i think, i'm just trying to confirm if that indeed was the place or some other place i went to lol
Brgr is supposed to be good
But let me know if that's indeed good food at organization_73
yeah hungry as fuck, any other fast food suggestion u got for now?
Nope still trying t o find good /cheap stuff here
Hey did u still want the team to meet at 7?
We could meet earlier since we're having dinner
yeah
And I was thinking we could just go to the porch or something
maybe like time-HL?
person_85 sounds good :)
wanna message the group
Sure
not in more wood rn, at my sister's
person_350 coming tomorrow!
Ik :)
HYPE
my parents are here lol so we're hanging out as a family during the weekend
i'll def see you at some point though!!!
That's nice
Have fun
Definitely... We live on the same floor :)
Never mind not important
Hope you're okay
lol i've never really had a headache
i just put my head underneath my body
i don't know how to describe it
like hang myself upside down
let the blood go to the head
Oh
I do that when my head's spinning
not even now, it's not really a headache
i should be fine
i can breathe with my nose now,
it got stuck just now
that and opm have amazing budgets in my opinion
that's why i'm just like ........ ok at your whole argument
nah one punch man has what is considered to be average budget
ok cool.
lol wtf is this shit
puts things into perspective right?
well i mean i know opm doesnt have shit tier animation
but its definitely not one of the best
and like i see all the best animation studios just animating stuff like girls adjusting their clothes or like butts or something and i feel like it's wasted
well it's not
well i think it is
ok
i understand you like this and most people do apparently
but just like.. why
acceptance?
i've been watching anime for a very long time.
so you just accept this is the way it is?
i mean i accept it to because theres nothing i can do about it
but i can still wish it were different
i am just so grateful haikyuu got a good studio
my poor shoujos can't even get the voice actors they need :(
lol good
why
because shoujos are trash
there's a key to run
i think alt or something
sorry minecraft is downloading an updae and destroying my connection
I can't find my house
I have no clue where I am
I have nothing on me
I don't like this
aw
if you build a new house make a trail of torches to it from spawn or something so you can get to it
I need torches tho
or like dirt cubes
anything for a marker
remember you can burn wood for charcoal so you don't need to find coal
OMG I found it
<3
How can I kill things? Nothing dies when I click it a lot
Like the silverfish
use a weapon
make a sword out of stone and sticks
where is the subject-HL class?
Tuesdays and Thursdays at location_31, from 3 to 4.20
But the class is packed full and there's no space to sit at all. Must be present there at least 10 mins before class to get space
oh
the prof has no problem for people sitting through?
I don't think so. But I wouldn't know
I haven't asked anyone permission to sit till now
ohk
He said people will decrease once the wait list is fixed, so that will take 3-4 weeks
cool
im just gonna sit through
Sure. :D he is teaching parts of linear algebra now
ugh
Wanna come to library
I'm gonna start hammering this fucker out
person_391's still here
luckily this is due thursday morning
oh is that what he means?
i'm gonna late day regardlesss
yeah dude
nah
as long as you get it in before he comes to school
is good
and he mentioned
i think that was for the 3d cases
anyway
yeah crunch time
OH THANK FUCKING GOD
but yeah
we have more time than you probably thought
although might ask you to take pictures of the textbook later
np
i might go home to use my own whiteboards later
i might just screw the fuckers into my wall haha
sscrew the fuckers?
I think it's a waste of money TBH
(y)
You should save that till you know what you need to buy for your dorm
you know those metal zebra ones?  they're like 8 for 2
Don't spend it cuz you have it
mhm
i do happen to be out of pencils and pens though
why I did the physics test in 4H :p
Then buy a pack for a dollar somewhere
Plus schools out basically
Oops
I have new mechanical pencils if you want :o
:p*
Plus a million too many pens
mhm
I'll put it back on the wish list
Maybe after I get that graduation ticket money
I'm gonna get a phone v soon
I'll pay my venmo when I get it
I just paid person_86 $12 through FB Messenger
What
$.01
$0.01
ok so i'm pretty sure the owl is going to be the most popular starter, so i might have to end up getting the seal for the hipster cred
Oh no don't
damn though, you guys. it's a lil baby owl with a lil bowtie
Its body is a banana
The Sean
Seal
Ok that's kinda cute
And realistically it's probably gonna have the best 3rd evolution
yeah i guess we'll have to wait and see
also i'll probably end up going with sun because i like the look of its legendary better and for no other reason
I hired a deer to threaten to run into the car of whoever messed up your acceptance email in the first place. I was thanking it for its offer to become a martyr to your cause
ah. how considerate
i do what i can
to inspire support among animals for you
does that make you a disney princess
Only if it makes me Sleeping Beauty I suppose. She's the only blonde that applies to.
lets go with no, that story's a little too close to necrophilia
that's what I was thinking. She's not one of my favorites
Just finished person_87 
Damn dude
person_88
Did the ending kill you
Kinda yeah
It was bittersweet 
It still burns me to this very day 
Rip person_89
My boi
: [
I felt so slighted 
person_69 can't catch a break man
Still I'm somewhat glad the ending wasn't all sappy
They had a bittersweet tone throughout the series, makes sense that they kept it at the end
Still
They could have done it differently 
Well every series could have ended differently to be fair
That's true 
But this one bothered me 
It was good and I wouldn't necessarily change it
That fait
Fair*
But it was like why b0ss
Yeah it did suck
so is this song
why is that poster so bad
what do you mean its great
oh
Can You Really Trust Anyone
lol
Can You?
i guess not
oh no you are person_407
sorry
do you not like me anymore
when do you finish school?
and when does your internship start?
you can trust me
i finish school time-HL[1]
internship time-HL[2]
oh so you probably cant come to person_408's graduation
oh when is that
21 i think
oh
ehh then can i change your rsvp from maybe to going
its human psychology the more ppl others see the more they will go!

I need to grab a buyer lol
Uhhhh price-HL[1]? *shrug* I dunno the hollo ratios for NN

cuz it didnt earlier
and i was about to reopen it to try with your code

hm ok
its better that i transfer files offline
not as easy to track
the torrent?
he cant torrent he lives on campus
right
so i cna just give him crack files and sht
kk
do we have to get usedto the wheel with the numbers or is there a way to switch it to the key names
click on tutorials and it'll tell you what key names they refer to
i actually dont know what mixed and key i ended up using, i just clicked updtate and it worked

The setup I did was wipe the drive > install puppy > follow organization_78 instructions > follow Minecraft instructions

Okay

Boooo

Tornado party!
You died?
No Pokémon
Have to stay inside
Accounting professor made us go downstairs
I bored
Class is a shelter
I pay attention!
No you're not
Also remember when I thought 1000 pokestops was a lot
?
I'm not even close
Yeah, there's still a decent gap between us
Yeah, I think this is more cuz of my lack of pokestops at home though
Probably a bit of both. There's definitely a XP gap
15 more minutes of tornado
Unless they renew the warning
I should pay attention
I go now
You go
So may be late. Have to furniture and then go to roommate meeting
You said that yesterday

Lol yes
Yeaaa my friends says i dress like a guy lol
hey person_101..
i dont rememeber if we talked about this..
?
how are the part time job opportunities there? job-HL will not reduce my tuition..so is it worth it?
It is good as it'll cover your living expenses
No deduction in tuition fees though
and if i don't get job-HL then?
If you don't get then nothing
RA is easier to get. Ppl generally get
other part time jobs?
Yeah.. Profs have companies on campus
You can join them
They all cover living expenses
woah nice..
so there is definitely a way to pay up for the living expenses while m there
Yup
That's possible
awesome thats what i wanted to know..
whats the avg living expense waise? $1300 per month?
We're rolling up on you person_102
Just left newark
Thanks birdman
Driving in?
Lol no, amtrak
Been on this train for nine hours
Jesus christ
It's honestly pretty ok if you don't actually have anywhere to be
Yeah I'm a fan of train travel
My neck would be busted after 9 hours on one of those trains though
About $33 for a cheap new one
yeah
you'll make that in like 2 hours or less this summer
Yeah
and you'll use it for more that 500 hours
Being optimistic eh
i mean thats assuming were at college 250 days a year and you get 4 hours a night
wait thats 1000 hours
yeah not i was being really pessimistic
What if I just sleep at Morewood the whole year
ok
Boom problem solved lol
Except she'll have a roommate
So my bed will be necessary for activities other than sleeping
yeah
So will the cheap bedframe be good for that
so now you want an expensive one?
I want the expensive one for a cheap price lol
person_353 do you even game-HL anymore
Worry about your own bed, I'll figure out mine
ok
I can't Minecraft now :(
My laptop charger is making it's journey from person_44's room in location_34 to mine in location_20 via snail mail
The class-HL take strings and return cursors

also he was wearing a studded belt yesterday
sweet emo 90s bb


i want to know what his tumblr is

Well I do have to talk to my parents once in a while you know
Videos I don't do often
Walking I already make an effort to tiptoe - i can't help it that the place is made of wood
Erm sorry about videos. Probably me.
If you want to talk about that, you wake me up everytime you open your door lol
And walk to the bathroom
Or your alarm
Or when you unlock the toilet door
What im trying to drive at is, I try to be as quiet as I can already, but the place makes noise and I can't help that
When you type on your keyboard it's loud enough to keep me awake when I'm trying to sleep
But guess what I just deal with it
Or when you scratch your legs. Or clip your nails
producer to watch on campus: link_6
Is this serious or no?
Also do you need anything? I'm going to wal mart to buy person-HL spray paint sometime today haha
he's from zbt I think, serious he's getting better haha. and nah, I'm headed yo organization_21 with my mom cuz she's never been
Oh right haha how's that?
not bad. reading articles in the car
you HAVE to go to Mama Ines bakery in lafayette
cheap as hell Mexican bakery with a huge selection of amazing shit
Oh god dammit. I love anything Mexican...
dude
we got 4 big donut things
and spent $3.56
HOLY SHIT
YEP
I need as many as I can get
they're open 5am to FUCKING 10PM
Holy shit that's a nightmare for employees hahahaha
But dat money do

Can we buy one for someones birthday?
Probably lo
gotta find those prices
Mmmmmm cake.
hey so person_414 can go to vg tonight
but there is a problem
??????
he needs a ride
I'll pick ur ass up then go get him
okay
But my sidemirror is fucked so you need to be my sidemirror
oh okay sorry
text me when you get here
haha I guess so
singaporeans are a different kind la I guess
All too smart haha
It's crazy how all of you keep saying you're stupid when you guys are the smartest bunch I've ever met
ehh really meh
I'm sure nus will have a lot of smart ones too, no?
Not in such concentration
organization_22 might have a high ranking, but honestly it's cos of its research
Not so much the students
WOMAN. WHAT HAPPENED TO MY UPDATE
HOW ARE YOU
ARE YOU DEAD
person_104
I'm dead inside
And so are my grades 
Shhhh. I'm treating you to brunch. If you don't have life by then, you will after a good ol' brunch with person_105.
It's the past now. Only the future to look forward to now.
You right as always
Of course! I AM SO AMPED.
Oh my god. I forgot how much I love reading good books.
Phew.
What books are you reading 
Well, I just finished Ready Player One.
Not just. FInished it a few ago. Few what? Idk. Around 11:11
But that's a thing.
What are you doing awake? What final do you have tomorrow?
None tomorrow thankfully
GOOD. SLEEP.
NOW.
organization_23 has a good ML group
I'm not sure how the job stats are 
But it's way cheaper. If you get Ra/Ta there, you might even end up spending nothing
If your goal was a PhD, I would have preferred organization_20 because of the faculty here and their reputation
I had similar goals but wasn't completely decisive about PhD
If I had got uta, my decision would slightly tilt in favor of that
It's good to be in a loan free situation at the end of your MS
hmm ya.. need to talk to some uta people before deciding
hey do mcds ppl get an advisor?
No, we have a program advisor but that's more for administrative purposes
oh i see.. btw do you know anyone at location-HL?
I know a guy who graduated a couple of years ago
I can put you in touch with him
that would be great!
How do I get food?
kill cows or pigs or chickens
or sheep?
yeah sheep too
you can cook the meat
How do I kill them? They run away
also there's bread
follow them lol
you can make bread by getting seeds (from hitting grass) and planting it on dirt by the water that's been hoed
How do I cook them? The furnace?
yeah
a furnace
not a forge
hah
i know words
there are also carrots and potatoes and stuff
melons
idk where you find all the seeds
Yo for the model auditions, how committed do I have to be to audition? Loll
Cause I kinda just wanna try out for fun :P and I don't really know what to expect
hahaha
right now just audition
its super chill
and u will get an email in the next couple of weeks
but i think if u get in, theres practice a lot
Lollll so let's say I do get in, I could reject the offer right..
I have your phone charger
cool, thanks
No sign of keys tho
That's ok
thanks for looking
Of course
I love you
I haven't said it in a while
I love you
I miss you
I miss you too
Should I set up the server from my house so you can play on it tonight?
Will that work?
Probs
Oh no my internet will go off
I forgot
That sucks
Rip
I'll just play a local game
And do that scholarship actually
(y)
It doesn't look like you
not trying to make it look like me XP
Why not

No you don't!

i'm a giant vertical worm
Well I think you're cute

And yes

ugh
Why ugh
I know organization_75 is ugly ;P
Oh,who said I was talking about person_106, I was clearly talking about myself and how pretty I am
That too

How can I compare, ugh
Find me a cute boy who thinks so
Done
?
I will do it
What if I don't find him cute
she doesn't know that i know what a penis is
I think she knows
well
maybe
I mean you took either health or biology at some point
she didn't know that until i told her i took the class
and that was to get out of her explaining sex to me
id k
I think she knows
i have nothing gogto to doooo
Draw penises
hmmmmmm
basically
just give up c:
noooo
i loVE YOU MORE
you aleady said you couldn't top it
i'll still try my best!
too late
darn they were sold out lol
so we couldn't have gone anyways
Yo read it
Managers get pretty stressed
Yeah I think I get that, but I feel like they also get rewarded by getting to work with campus, I'm just not sure that doing strictly logistics is worth it, atleast for me
Gotcha
You can still be involved with Campus
But you just don't have executive say over shit
We're gonna release the new structure today
Yeah, hmmm
You guys are forsure going with this new structure?
Yeah
2 cap
2 asst cap
2 manager
aiight
Will send out email
With the responsibilities
Outlined later today
aigyht yeah id def want a definite set of responsbilities before deciding
Sounds good
okay! will let u know soooon
"youths 7-17" after three pm weekdays but iirc they never asked for any ID
lmao good shit
day_1 works better for me but if day_2 is best for u that's okay
I might have plans for Monday
I'll get back to u on that by Sunday I think
I'LL TRY

haha okay will do!!
Hopefully 
I think it's up on organization_24 
I'll watch it after GL
I'm onto justice League new frontier
My boi manhunter is trying to learn about humans through tv
Oh yeah that's how all Martians do that
They briefly mention in YJ that Martians love television 
Thus one is weird, it's set in 1954
Everyone loves television 
It was probably made a while ago
The the animated movie series has come out with 25 movies since 07, which is ridiculous 
This is only the second 
Damn dude
They pump those out like crazy
They're currently making the killing joke
I know, I'm really hyped for it
It's rated r
I don't think any of them are under pg-13
These things are legit 
Yeah but that's the only one with an r rating 
Which means it'll be serious business 
Oh no
gpa going up is a nice feeling
Should get food 2 celebrate
And give me
I have 0 food
if you were still here i could have given you lil nips
I miss having food 5 minutes walking away

I got like 500k in the last level alone
jeez
you know what we need to start watching for?
announcements about alive year_1
Year_2
True true
We're definitely getting to that point
cuz we need to go to that together
kk
If not we'll probably use CU since I have store credit
But BC universe is an option too
Cause one is 832 and the other is 834
And idk if organization_25 is free shipping
Im assuming I can get this shipped to your place right?
Yeah I'll just need a heads up of when.
Should be a couple days before the case drops
That itll arrive
Wait wat
Yeah CU and BCU are both known to send out before release day
So we'll probably get it on Wednesday or Thursday
oh, I thought you meant like this week and I was about to question your health
I said before it drops lol
whoops i was asleep last night
No worries mangg
what's up
Haha nothing
It's just you were on
oh hm at that time?
weird, i was asleep
Yeah its weird lol
im on data and stated a game :0
person_115
Ok just tell me when then I guess
yeah sorry it was bad all around
i tried to tell you i was ready
but my phone wasn't doing it?
It's OK, my person_491!
Just let me know if you wanna
yeah i will!
Okay no more Minecraft for tonight
why no
I have to wake up early tomorrow
for what?
jury selection
ohhh
I have to go sit at the courtroom from 8am to whenever they say I can go
uhhohhh
If they had free wifi I'd just play Minecraft all day there lol
I don't think you're allowed to do  that lol
I'm allowed to do that
Except there's very limited internet
really?
So it probably won't be fast enough
Yeah
you can play?
what kind of jury selection is that
so chill lol
It's mostly sitting there waiting for them to call you
i thought it's the suspect/ the victim pointing at people who they know or might know
Lol no that's a line up
dunno what all these means
lol
Lolll
How did it go?
i just modify it abit
tech ing 1 name_1
basically just take the deck and starts playing it again cos fed up with prism
and stomps everyone
Why you fed up with PRISM?
cos can never stomp ppl
LOLOL
never win convincingly
like win, but hardfought match
and more like i think again about aqua
bad matchup is only cbd
machining is easy af
name_2 also same
while name_3
only good matchup is vs control deck
and 50/50 against everything else
then i try to analyze every single matchup i got during last time_1 of my name_4 events
not many cbd/name_2/control deck
more shadow/rg based deck/location_1
which is hard to beat anyway with name_3
I mean BT has alot of good marchups
It doesn't have very many band ones due to large handsize and Vert
hey guys if you don't mind changing topics because this one is a little bit too vague, i came up with another idea and have an initial diagram_1 sketched out
so the user of our Database would be somebody who analyzes university acceptance statistics
in the database will be students, sports they played, high school, and college they attended
so the analyst can find trends like how many students that go to organization_20 have an test_1 higher than score_1
or how many students that go to organization_26 play golf
i'm in and if y'all are i'll get started on redoing part A
and get started on part B b/c i think it'd be great if we had the bulk of those two done tonight
i'm starting to put the diagram_1 on lucidchart so part B will be easy once we're done with that
sorry to make your guys' meeting last night go to waste. i just don't think we had a clear idea of what we were trying to do with the last topic
i love all this info about loans i'm not eligible for
also congrats on our gross matching profile pics
we're that couple now
They don't match
the thumbnails are p close
it's not matching matching
but it's definitely not the standard headshots :p
btw yours got more likes
only 17 :p
(i'll quit bugging you at work.  see you later <3)
See
And at horse island did we only see adults too?
I think
Horse island
Yes
That's not what is called
location_35?
Yes
Oh
It's a horse island
I guess
during the test this guy kept on murmuring to himself, gesturing to the paper, gesturing to the air
it was really distracting
Oh I hate that stuff
i wanted to tell him to chill out
the testing environment was really bad
I'm sorry
people like 6 inches away from me on either side
Lol the app now tells me your emotion after every message
You are sad apparently
Haha yeah I can but just warning you our options are super limited lolol
I work at location_82
Station
Lol that's fine it's more about just catching up
Haha ahh I feel bad making you come all the way here
But you can go to danshui if you have time haha
What day are you thinking of?
Lol no worries it's just that my parents want to reserve all my dinner time lol
We can totally go for drinks too hehe
I see I see
No problemo
Lol I am going to a lounge on time_1
But don't know if u would go drink on a time_1 lol
As long as I can catch the mrt home I'm alright hahaha
It's with a friend from location_36
She's knows person_116 and the other person_117 as well

Jealous

Haha yeah 
The fixtures sucked though 
Or like, hotter than I wanted
I've been thinking lots about visiting
Haha yeah they weren't the nicest
When you visit next time I have a private bathroom
That'll be nice
Deffs
They're starting doubles at 2 
Okay
Thabks

Just hit
person_118 courts not free :(

Thanks
i have a python question
sure
wait actually
where're you rn?
at school
gonna get some stuff done
can i call you quickly?
did that lab, i'm going to email person_404 and figure out my course schedule
sure
let me get my earbuds
do you need to figure out your schedule rn?
i feel like i didnt do that till much later in the summer
in your child file:/n/nimport Parent/n/nclass Child(Parent):/n  ...
What
Where are you then
My apartment I couldn't goi have been puking
Oh shit, im sorry bro
Yea
Can I still stop by and pick up the location_37 deck box tho
Cause I need to ship tomorrw
Yea text me when u get here I'll bring it down
Kk thx bro
I have been sleeping so i feel bettr
Let's move to this chat
We're actually going to get a cake right now
Oh
person_120
Yay
We could either bring that somewhere or have a thing at home
Wanted to ask if he's willing to go out or not
Problem is that the present isn't coming until tomorrow :/
We can show him what it is
He'll get it tomorrow anyways
Sure, yeah
I know he's in an exam right now, but we can ask what he wants to do when he gets out
i did hash table rn
at stress testing it is literally not running
.-.
the rest of the cases work
RIP
i think i had that problem for a bit
don't remember what fixed it though
i moved over to testing in sublime
What is everyone else pricing their apartment ? 
500 is so little 
idk it was a random number
a lot of people are subletting rooms in houses for ~ 500
how much are you willing to sublet for
Depends for how long. Letting 2 people stay the whole summer for just 1000 Barely covers anything 
covers what?
like utilities?
Bills and rent 
i mean i dont think it would cover rent
wait not 1000 the whole summer
like 500/person/month
If it only covers bills, then what's the point of subletting 
how much are bills?
its def less than a few hundred r
i mean we can charge them plus utitilies so they dont go crazy on ac
so it would just be comcast which is like 50/month
its def more than barely covering it
Yeah why don't we only charge amount_1 utilities
Or amount_2
Idk 
wait didnt you just say 500 is low...
were you worried about utilities?
I can't explain how much you mean to me
You make me feel so complete
I set my alarm for 7
Gross I'm sorry
I'm pretty tired
mhm
long day in the heat
I loved today with you
So did I
I wish I could stay up and talk with you forever
I know
You've changed my life somehow
I don't know what I'd do without you
I'd be so lost
Goodnight person_225
I love you so much
Goodnight person_121
I love you too
SMUG BOIS
i'm glad routers are so secure
:p
(netgear routers have a vulnerability where you can get to a root console on the router just by being able to connect to the network)
Lol person_121 I literally don't know any of the words you just said
oh yeah that's not a windows word
all mac/linux computers have a root account, which is like an administrator or SYSTEM user on windows
with netgear routers like mine, having the wireless password lets you get into a command prompt signed in as root
which normally takes a different username and password
Oh ok
anyway i'm gonna go set up port forwarding and give you an IP for today
i'll bring it over tomorrow
i found a computer engineering scholarship i should do
Cool
Did you get my email?
I miss you too
i don't know wtf is going on
i logged into the server locally
and literally it's back to the world seed
but the one on my comp isn't
and it wasn't before
so now I think I need to transfer everything around again
Okay
Be careful
i have a backup on my flash drive with the corruption from yday
Ok
i just don't know why the server is rejecting it all of a sudden
Thanks for doing this
It seems like kinda a pain
it is now that the file's corrupted
that what i'm annoyed about
otherwise i'm happy to work on this stuff
Mhm
I guess I could
maybe
idk I did have that free peezy at time_1
anyone down to hang out/y'all about feelings tonight tho
Im leaving now from campus to rose tea
Have a paper to write after so maybe hang out at like time_2, but no guarantees
jeesh
Its not a fun week for me
I will pray 4 u
The organization_27 only wipes a backrow unit
So it's not as strong as person_406
Wtf
Brutal in the mirror
Booty
It doesn't seem to have a cost tho lol
I mean you can spin Tick tock for free
Yeah
GG should be revealed in the next episode
Why's that?
Cause Chrono is gonna play, I mean they might just show GG and then wait another week to show the effect
Or pull that Blaster Joker shit
person_122 doesn't play next week lol
We won't see name_1 il the end of month_1
I mean he was running up the stairs to get to person_123
Next week is shion.
Then tohkaha and then am
Doesn't the season end next month lol
Nah
Not til late next month.
You sure
person_280 check the preview
Is person_362 ok
I slept
Oh good morning
Rocket launch didn't go well
Oh why
Most engines and igniters were bad 
Only 1 of our 4 igniters worked 
Oh no
Laughing
Yes that is what everyone said
Oh
Cry
We try again next semester with new igniters and engines
Oh no
That's it?
What's it

Nope
It's k

dnag
hot dog
hot dog?
i want hot dog
will they have hot dog at carnival
oh yes
listen to ill be there by hollywood undead
do you like ths song?
i do yeah
bullet is good too
i also like everywhere i go but its also a ridiculous song
oh i don't like this folksy style
this is not folksy style at all
maybe a little because of the slight acoustic guitar in background
but its just like generic pop
oh
you would probably like bullet more
ill be there is not like their other songs at all
most of their songs are rappy/punk
What about a pay plan
What are you gonna do about references?
Idk
Did you take stafford loans?
I think so
who'd you put?
according to college confidential they're so the feds can get in contact with you if you move without changing your address on the site
Actually I'm not sure if I did
Oh shit have you seen Stranger Things?
not yet
God dammit. Watch it. person_124 (the sherrif of the town in the show) is literally person_125.

Okay fuck your beer is zero as well
Did you brew it too long
wtf this shouldn't even be possible.  Zero is supposed to only be spawned
No zero is normally unobtainable
never stops
He's gonna sue you?
idk
That will never work, 1.
Like, what will he sue you for? Abusive words/behaviour? Damaging of reputation that was mostly his doing? He is in a blue af state. Good luck with that. Jackass
What did emma do?
she just put him on blast
Also using your legal name like wtf
How?
well
ory texted her a threat
Wtf. Saying what

and that he was going to list her as a status_1
What is an llc again?

last minute suggestions for DEMO
:)
Haha
You'll be fine
Ooh it's tomorrow
yup
Make sure you can explain your design in terms of scalability, availability etc
Would this design work for say measurement_1 Objects_1? If not, what challenges would need to be tackled
How does your system behave with respect to CAP theorem
Make sure your demo works :D
Ok
Thank you
It's pretty chill as long as it works.
I'd suggest practicing it once :
:D
Yes..doing it
All the best :D
What did you guys make?
by the way, that job offer was from a democratic congressman running for reelection in maryland
and
they were hiring people to run press or something
I still don't have a job
Neither do I
I need to follow up  but essays
want to also apply to the organization_28? they take rolling applications
I don't even have anything sent out rip
I want to do something job_1 related
I have a family friend who can offer a job_1 I think
in profession_1
Eh, I was supposed to follow up with some friends but didn't
I htink I will try to get job on my own. Thanks though
oh, thats for me, not you
oh lol
Yeah yo
You should date a kpop star
Thx person_354
What
You should
I mean
If I could I would?
maybe you could ask them on one of the streams
Are you registered to vote?
this shape makes me feel uncomfortable
ok i'll try bullet
your cad class is much more in depth than mine
i have to figure out so much stuff myself
wtf bullet sounds even more folksy
why does this shape make you uncomfortable
its a happy song about suicide
idk it just looks wrong
weird i go back to listening to mystery skulls
person_362 doesnt like my music
rust fails to compile program_1 on my laptop. lol. no idea why
there is a compiler panic
what error does it give? lol
Are you using 1.7?
yes
Compiler panic!
I'll try that. could be a bug in 1.8.
but it compiled the same thign before didnt it?
I usually work on my desktop
I'm setting things up on my laptop because I'm heading home for the weekend
oh!
neat. it panics too
omg
I wonder if it is failing at something that isnt completely uninstalling...no worries. I'll figure it out
Ahoy
just saying hello - and craving some green beans
Hey. Next time ur in town lets get some
IF IM EVER IN TOWN
i want to come but flights are like 700$ + from here
kinda disgusting
Ya that sucks
I might try to come around the 3rd week of October depending on how 1st round of Finals go
how are things holding up for you @ location_93 (i know that person_139 is still there... hahah)
Model is done hahaha
haha show me on Skype
Dude it's terrible, but everything is okay haha
hahaha
Like, it's my coat rack next to the front door hahaha
yesssssss
But! It meets the requirements. Do we have to make the custom attributes to make it add more parts, or nah?
idk read the requirements hha
fuck who's in my squad
Ugh fuck. I have to download them and that's a hassle and I hate the internet cuz people are mean and the lobsters are dying at an alarming rate and all I can think about is how person_140 will never come back but is now a character foever immortalized in Overwatch and how people exploit this for their own personal gain and then take to conventions where their hate mongering brings the wbc and then people counterprotest which only gives them more power and thw religious zealots will only grow stronger forming new cults believing in the same bullshit that has indoctrinated much of the modern world and now I'm crying while sitting on the toilet.
what the fuck just happened
get on skype jesus christ
That is pure stream of consciousness hahahahahahahahahaha
yeah but filter that shit lmao that was hilarious
i swear to god i better know everyone on my team

Actually, what was your role in it?
I didn't do anything LOL 
Then nevermind. Definitely don't want to go lolol 
But art
So I wouldn't be in the show 
Lol okay 
I almost felt bad for a moment 
person_454 went to see person_455 during buggy and person_141 mentioned that no one ever came to see her . And then we realized we also never watched you or person_456. It was so poorly advertised to the sisters that no one ever thought to go. And I realized that it so dumb we don't support each other and then complain that person_457 always go to each other's shows and crap
But since you didn't do anythibg, I don't feel bad anymore LOL
LOL yeah that's true 
We should support each other more 
I think culture night is the only thing we support each other in. And maybe organization_29?  
You sold me. i don't read hentai normally, but this seems funny. hmu

Try best to ignore ads
gotchu
person_144 have fun
Theres only 6 chapters out rn or something so yaa
Oh hey I never saw this
I hope I don't drive like that
Well I mean it's mostly a matter of style
Is that how you drive... 
No, not stylish enough sadly
I went outside and that was better 
And I went to person_439s
And person_439 asked me if I was ok
Because she says I look off color
:(
Oh no...
person_440 knows
I'm glad you were feeling better outside though
Yeah
It felt better to walk around
Oh! 
I had a weird water bottle encounter on the bus
Oh?
Also I gotta get dinner but I'll be back soon!!
How'd person_145?
fucking fun
my favorite so far is the ninja guy
I want to play that game almost solely for him
he basically has a burst fire gun in the way he throws shurikans
he can also climb walls and deflect bullets
person_145 is just super accurate single shot
and then close range spam
"We tried this out and our first cat was #145 and the second was #434, so it’s unclear exactly how many there are to collect."
ummmm
@ Google
Infinite cats
i'm still waiting on a single cat
Did you already get nougat wtf
Oh right
Nexus
ya
Gdi
i wish i got nexus 6 but 5x is pretty good
Is that what he's talking about? Honestly, that's also stupid as fuck. 
just heard from anotehr transgirl i know
and she said hes pretty much not an ally
just because youre friends with lgbt people
doesnt auto make you an ally
Exactly. It's a stupid argument. 
But is that what he was referring to and your friend helped you remember?
no he wasnt referring to that
but
i think back to when i did consider him a friend
and i realize that his comments that night
were a red flag
Wtf
again like
red flag
those kinda of words
red flag
shouldve seen this
hey :) do you knnw what the physics hw means?
Uhh i think like the content? Or if its the numbers then we had to pick up a few printed out chapters from another txtbook in ghoshs office at wean and the problems are in those packets
I didnt do it yet tho
wait
we were suppose to pick something up?
Yeah, i think he sent out an email around a week ago?
D:
Most of the content is chem, and i can take a pic of the questions for u later if u need :)
how big is the packet?
and this is what i get for not readig emails thoroughly
There were like three ranging the length of a chapter each so around... 15ish sheets maybe?
15 per chapter
or total?
Per chapter sadly
x.x
please send me the questions
how much do you tihnk we need the actual chapters to do the hw
fuuuuuuuuuuuuck
they always do such a good job with making all the starters adorable as shit
I wanna go with the owl since I don't like cats, but...the seal
Are you a popplio sympathizer
To be fair it kind of looks like a dog in a seal suit
are you saying popplio is not a precious baby
Popplio is literally a clown
a precious baby clown steal
seal
also person_479 you should get a 3ds and get monster hunter generations and then Pok�mon
you should get generations too, person_146
What's that
the newest monster hunter game?
it's dope as shit, here let me find a trailer
Do I look like a monster hunter
maybe
link_7
Ok that looks cool I GUESS
you can also play as a cat
Ok.... Ok....
Ok person_408...........
You know me....
I might take the opposite tack, since I have almost all of month_1 off
and I want to get out of this town...
have you set aside a time to fly back?
late month_1
I have to go back for a friend's engagement party
ah, that sounds nice
and its a good time to get out of this swamp...
a recharge back home is always good
it's a quick turnaround though
probably less than a week
if I do help out, it's probably mostly phonebanking
you'd probably be better off just using that time to relax or catch up with people
if it's that short
well, phonebanking here in city_1
not phonebanking there
ah, yeah
yo does it show i liked like 5 models in the activity bar?
not currently
oh so u cant see that i liked anyone?
i mean if i go to your profile
i probably could
but not activity bar?
nope
because I unliked all of them aftr 10 sec
also back to my suicide philosophy
because im on my computer
ok
basically
i think the only grounds to commit suicide is when you hAve 0 people that care about you
*due to mental health
obviously assisted suicide due to terminal illness is an exception
but basically like if you have even one person in the world who would be hurt by your suicide
you're a selfish cunt for doing it
thats me
philosophy
ya
its one i developed last year
yes
I mean the download
yes
also, my friend told me today that apparently someone who I don't know told them that he is into me
which like, is kindof cool, but I really like this boy, but I'm afraid that he thinks I'm acting desperate
but like, no, I have other options, I just want him
Yea
I mean, I was pretty hot dancing on stage at the after quarty in my tank top
too bad he couldn't see me
;P
I just don't know what to do
but I'm doing a lot, and there's not much more I can do
wazzaa
back to good ol' town?
link_8
Yus
Want to go here this friday?
Walking to lab
am in krach
What's that
some concert at loeb
“Ain’t That a Kick in the Head” Big Band music from 1960 featuring music of person_147 and person_148, as well as 1960 releases from Count Basie, person_149, person_150, and person_151. Featuring the organization_30 and American Music Repertory Ensemble (organization_31). Free and open to the public!
person_152
cool! Put it on your calendar
:P
But jazz can get boring after a while
actually
i feel like we never went to these free concerts
Yus yus
and we missed that part of Purdue Life
so we should prolly attend few :P
especially the free ones
hihihih
if not that then: link_9
Weird black box? Screenshot?
Also, make sure your cache is clear just in case
Hmmm okay, I'll try and recreate it.  Maybe it's a bug
I just typed up the series of steps I'd like the presentation to go through
it's entitled Title_1
(mostly for person_153's benefit
*nods* good good
Does anyone know if the slides are finished?
In a related note, we just finished our presentation. Yay!
oh today i learned that i got matched with an intern
oohh
are you working with them in summer?
lol i dont know how that's gonna go
yea
sounds like it'll be interesting
yea. a bit nervous too at the same time
i think you have enough experience to do pretty well
person has won math olympiad in location_1 and placed thrid in international infomatics olympiad
oh what
lol why do they even have to intern at that point..
lol he's still attending college
at location_1
i guess software isn't the same thing as math and informatics
yea. competitive programming is probably pretty different too
sounds like it'll be a good experience for both of you
Idk what this GIF is
But it doesn't matter
You're not going to respond to it either way
Then why would you send it to me
To get you to respond
Duh
It worked
Congrats I guess
Yay
:p
We'll get more chances
I love you
I love you too
So the original plan stands. Take the brown line to person_154 after school and I'll meet you there
ok :)
Why doesn't my phone give me messenger notifications it's driving me crazy
oh that's annoying
the shitty tech training offer guy emailed me
said he'll call at 3:30
Numbers game this bitch
go on
Work for a non start up haha
Unless them shits already a household name
But smaller than fold
organization_32
person_155
googl
Haha
That's larger than ford haha
is it?
100%
organization_32 is a dying corpse
Also most of the work force is Mexican manufacturing
Instead if IT and engineering
lol
I mean like if I interview enough I'll find people that will appreciate my style ha
true
so volume of finding ppl
holy shit so im listening to one of logics mixtapes (ive been getting into him past month or so)
one of the songs comes on and it samples corridors of time from chrono trigger
i genuiely get goosebumps and tear up a little
incredible
Every song is a good song person_156
but just the fact that he samples that one song
was just likel
holy fuck
just as a heads up, it's been confirmed that I have arrhythmia, specifically tachycardia. need to cut energy drinks out, work out more, and eat less sugar at one time
Well fuck. What even is that?
it's like if you have an irregular heart beat but then gets escalated
tachycardia means my heart rate gets exceedingly fast for what it should be
Well fuck. You wanna work out with me and person_157 this semester?
wat? lel
oh i read that wrong
yeah, if not that i'm planning to do so with my roommate
just need regular exercise
I was gunna say, that's fairly easy to understand. We're gunna lift mwf and I run after.
nice, i'm planning to do mwf mornings, and I prefer running first :P
Jesus hahaha I go at nights
nights would work except clubs
Lame.
This has been a good week for us hahaha
not at all lol
person_158 took away our K drive privileges lol
Lol how are you supposed to share things
She gave us a folder within the k drive
No access to anything else
Pretty glad I'm done with this job after this quarter
I feel bad for person_425
Lol
I thought he was graduating early
Oh yeah haha
Just so he doesn't have to work here
Probably not a year early though
Too bad she's the worst
person_159 is super excited to leave too
Where is person_160 going?
She's graduating
Going to more school in like location_38 or something
Oh EVERYONE is leaving
lol ya
We finally replaced person_161 though
I wonder if you'll learn some great things you never considered haha
nope we're mediocre plus
Lol
Man I'm going to get a job haha
Tvix up 20% now lol
Fuck
Haha well yeah
I can't even explain it
Lots of uncertainty ahead
I mean do you think it'll go up tomorrow

I'll lyk I'm tryna finish this off before practice 
Where you gonna ve

Yea second half haha
Such a pity, cos my friend went to help me check it out today and he says it's a really good deal, only problem is the other guy moving on halfway ):
Presentation is... Ok I guess? Slides hasn't been submitted, now all I need to do is memorize my script
Need to go school tmr at 830 for rehearsal =-
oh, how much does it cost leh?
wahhh that's super early
and you have to go to etc some more, so far away
Haha yea unfortunately
It's OK ba, only half an hour by bus?
10min if my housemates are willing to fetch me, though that's highly unlikely
The person was saying 2350 for the entire summer! 
She's not sure when the guy is coming yet so see how
But for now it's 800/month
ohh wowww
thats quite cheap what
for the whole summer
hahah
sleep early?
Haha yea!
but need to memorize script right
And I get my own room too!
Yea I hate memorizing stuff ):
I've such a terrible memory
And my slides barely have any text and I can't use presenter mode =-
i don't think so
i have a lot of work due next week
what time do you want to go for coffee?

Okay. I will come over.
Although, I might have to catch the next one.
Why...
:c
person_162 school started right??
Also, meal plan~~
I decide to do this thing where for every lb I lose victor has to gain and vice versa :)
Yeah! I'll help u meal plan next week cuz i met a bodybuilder chick who can help us out
Omg yayyyy ^^
U know how hard it is to gain a pound of muscle muscle for person_393?
Fat is so much easier to lose
Or burn off
Lmao
so the rabbits were definitely getting out
idk how but i saw two jump over the fence
so i made it higher
Legit?
How
i don't know
Spook
they're not supposed to be able to
probably some clipping bs
Great! It's very rewarding to be a mother :) /nWe received quite sometime ago, but i kept forgetting to message you hehe
Oh haha ok
How old is person_163 now!
Must be really tiring for you guys!
But he looks like a really well mannered baby though (:
Thanks! Yes now already can see a bit of the characteristics
It's tiring but manageable, we are quite blessed in the many helps we received
How is everything there? Miss home? how long more
Got 75$ more :p
You must think I'm cheap :p
lol
why 75 now
and dont send me pics here naah
it shows up on my laptop
send pictures on hangout
or whatsapp
I didn't know okay
so you want me to just make come up with prices for the 3 rooms?
the one with the guitar in the picture is gonna be the double right?
Yeah I'm just trying to see if there's a consensus for their value. I think it's also a good idea to meet sometime before the end of before the end of the semester to talk it out too.
yea ok
I was actually talking about the other room with the giant bed in it
When we were there they seemed about the same size, just one had a giant bed
mk
The guitar room might be slightly bigger, but it's kind of a dumpy room. We wanted to give the double people the best room. We could decide instead to make the other the double. We just wanted to have one picked out as the double now so it can be factored in when evaluating.
Ok, well i actually like the small room best but since the other one is bigger it should prolly be valued higher, so maybe price_1 for the double room, price_2 for the small room, and price_3 for the guitar room
Ok thank you for the input
Its a bitch's tomb made just for you
Oh you finally bought yourself a bed for my place? Sweet, welcome to the organization_77. [:
That means I can have your sheets right?
And back to ignoring you.
I told you that I got your tomb
person_164
Also did you make the post?
No, I'm studying for Midterms, plus my posts go un-noticed about it.
Damn it :/
Hey

We need for storage

Order it tonight?
I don't have prime anymore

so i think ima do it at alpha phi house
Ugh okay

What are they doing with their lives
They could legitimately use this as resume material if they were intending to go into digital design
okay maybe not the best resume material
but still! for want of a meme!?
Memes are love
Memes are life
born too early to explore space

I TOLD YOU I HAD THAT TRASH WEEB CHILD FRIEND. 
TRASH JAPANESE*
no but like the first time i personally talked to him
bc of tinder
it was wild
Omg. What was the convo
roughly how it went
OMG LOL
Yo he was so cute for that. 
Much since. 
an angel
Sin*
A N G E L
so yeah after 5 years in the same school i meet him in person for the first time at location_90
a wild ride
Why did you not meet in school?
a wild set of endless just misses
Omg
no like literally i run into the auditorium and he comes to find me 5 seconds later and is like she's gone
700 for the split room
625 for the dark room
61
610
If you want to run the numbers use spliddit 
So 350 each for split one?
Yes
What I meant earlier is that if you share numbers before they're finalized people can use math to their advantage
Ok  I will run the numbers later and see if I think it's fair and then we can meet to discuss and get this thing over with
No
You can do straight out of bank
Ah. Okay. How...?
Link your bank acocunt
It says add credit card or bank account
I did all that already I think I got this
Btw this is proof about the new mat
That mat is beautiful
First time a bushi mat like this will be full sized yo
I'll do the 20. name_1 is one of my favorite units
Kk
So friday?
Just give me til day_1
Next question. Can you get sleeves for vanguard cards? I just want solid dark blue or just not light blue
I'll obviously pay for them and I'll do shipping as well. I have no place that sells minis near me :(
So like ultra pro or Bushiroad sleeves?
Ultra pro?
The company
No I know that haha
Some people want the bushiroad art sleeves lol
I meant like yeah I'll do that
Bushi sleeves are expensive
Ohhh okay itll probably be like 4-5 bucks with shipping
1 pack right
At least he used mathcad
You should sleep

Lol
before 5

are you sleepy
i mean sleeping
No not done with proxy 
And not sleeping
I slept for a couple of hours
Apparently I fell asleep in a chair in my friend's room and then I went to sleep in his bed and then I walked to my room and went to sleep in my bed
next level sleep walking
I don't remember any of that but someone took a picture of when I was sleeping in my friend's bed
i just slept and ignored like 10 phone calls
:(
lol
Apparently my friend was sleeping too
lol that's not a very comfortable position to sleep in
lol
you guys are funny
I don't know, I thought I went to sleep in my bed to start with and then I woke up in my bed
When I woke up I didn't know I ever sleeping in his room
Lol
I can't afford that
Timewise
Not moneywise
Yea it's OK bebe
I knew
I'll come to your get together
For a little bit
I have a lab report due on Friday so I'll have to work on that tomorrow lol
Gay

New G guard is ass, maybe the crit
I can wait on the BB stride
I thought you liked the new name_1
Might go to person_483 tonight if club thing ends early
Or if I get bored
Might go to person_483 tonight if club thing ends early
lolk
Big belly stride is garbo
I would highly disagree but ok lol.
I tested with friends, no situation comes up where I would ever need it in either deck
Also I'm considering converting to Big belly cause the legion feels slow
Belly is surprisingly potent
At least testing would suggest
Although most of the new support is too slow
I like a good bit of the new GN stuff they got.
Trust me it's awful in testing
The new stuff is insanely slow
Fuck
I have no time
For studio work?
Yeah
Oh no :( what's studio work
Idk
But I need to have something to show
I didn't plot my stuff out yet
Cab you show them what you did on the comp?
Yeah but I'd rather print
Maybe

Living with you will be fun
Yes hehe

I just got picked up by person_179

Anyone else?
And I'll get dropped off at location_41

You and your dad?
Yeah
A duo indeed 
Everything going on otherwise?
Ah? 
I still haven't peed
Sorry, meant to ask if everything else is going ok
I got some gross chips at the vending machine at the station 
And I lost all of the hearthstone games I played 
I'm still losing all my games
Yikes
Yeah I'm pretty bad at hearthstone 
I wonder if it's just your strategy 
Youre usually a little hasty 
I guess so
I don't really know how to fix it
Oh yeah hehe
How r u doing

but eh
That's good
I might go late night

Whatever weird panic attack stress feeling thing is back and worse rn
oh no
I'm sorry
does taking slow breaths help?
remember you don't have anything left to do today
I don't know it's not like I'm overwhelmed with work
I want to spend more time by myself
Or quietly with you
Mhm
i just put away 11 stacks of dirt
and there's still more riverbed to dig out
im almost to the sea
for some reason there's a big flat border to the ocean
Hm
oh no :(
eh I just asked person_416 if she was going to the potluck party
she sai yes
said
YAY
haha at least only nearly, not actually oversleep
THANKS
Well my housemate has very loud footsteps and that woke me up
Haha I'm in a client meeting now
Boring stuff
what's the name of that games place by biglots
We have a big lots here?!
lol
I have no idea, evidently hahaha
nevermind hahaha
I tried, but my knowledge of this area is limited hahaha
it's by blue moon comics
I found it
Oh! Dope. What's there?
it's a small shop with a bunch of old games and systems
gonna try and go there to snag an old sysyem
Oh that's awesomd.
Get an snes
maybe
Or a 64
person_418 is bringing a 64 but I'm looking to cop a game cube or ps2 or 3
Mmmmm good call. If not, pick up a ps4 for cheap somewhere.
person_184 still wants to do that
I just know we won't get one for a while
Makes sense haha they're a little pricey still.
yeaaaah he's looking for deals from other people, but that won't pan out for a bit. I'm also itching a nostalgia scratch so
hard cringe link_11
Oh no.
Ohh okay
A lot of yr undergrad work is in signal processing only, correct ?
Yes right
Hmmm okayy
So where r u now? How was internship at organization_20?
Ohh it was very good
Learnt a lot of things
Also got to talk to a lot of profs there
I'm planning to do a year long internship
So I talked to the profs over there about it
Oh cool, great!
You could probably try to get a fully funded admission there for masters?
Oh my god my head person_348
I can't thinks
Think
:x
I'm sorry
I totally didn't get ready for bed btw
I might pass out or puke
I'm gonna go do that

I'm not home
Just left the theater

I'm in a car
close your eyes?
i'm sorry
People are loud

Yessir. I should be good after time_1
I have a 220 lab but I'm gonna go in early and knock it off quickly
No sweat. Sig ep again or somewhere else?
SigEp works fine with me
Let's do it. I'll meet you whenever you're ready then
I'm so painfully close to getting predicting working, I hope to have it by tonight
awesome
then it's tweaking right?
Ideally. I wrote down some notes from our meeting last week and we can revisit those
Ah I have so much to do tonight actually
yikes
what do you have besides learntomod?
I need to email that guy
And email person_178
oh yeah
And a lot of LTM
and we're not home yet
mhm
And I don't really feel like working
Have you gotten any more done?
well the server is alive (needed a resource file) and i figured out startup
but i can't get it to host over ssh
which is like something you need to have for a headless server
you want remote config+control
Nope, woke up and ran for the bus
What happened
13% for VIx
2% for TVIX haha
Both positive????
of course
Time to buy xiv
but like I've never seen the VIx outperform the TVIx this bad
Mhmm
Job a csuite dude is here , phones off
Ooh*
lol
don't buy XIV
XIV is only down .37%
Work!
Cults
Both if you're lucky
But work doesn't always have a bunch of people your age or people who are cool enough to hang
Then I guess you're in the wrong field
I see you have not refuted cult
Of course not, cult friends = friends 4 lyfe
But cults are too much work for me
Do u think we r a cult
O
That image was just a circle?
No, you can't have a cult with just 2.5 people
.5?
Is that a race thing because half black
person_185 gets kidnapped a lot
Or because each
Ah yes
Beat me to it
Wow I would neva
NOT TOO LATE
square if you want it positioned a certain way or else I'll just crop it for you no problem!
YAY :)

Mid afternoon I think

Cause I feel like 8 trillion links on our what'sapp
Ya ya ya

Yes. And I can do $70 for the two if you want them
Ill think about the person_436s but yeah I can do the 22

brutal...
we didn't even lose, just tied

no show me urs
quick i have to go tosleep
same
aight
show me
this one chick has a good current profile picture
but i dont want you to find her
Now!
Just finished asking people about them haha
Woo!! Yayayay :)
Apparently a Senior organizes an order every year.  I don't know who is doing it this year but it looks like you could just get in on the order!
No worries about not having enough; I just had no idea they order them every year
Ohhh gotcha gotcha
Lmk who to venmo and I'll do it ^_^
will do :)
How's your day been?
ok
uneventful
I know you don't want to, but are you gonna look at your letter at all today?
Yeah
I'll eat lunch first
Pbtttt it's four
(I know it's late :p)
kk I'll try. Cuz idk this chick at all. I see her every day_1 day_2 when I catch the bus to school tho.
Just start with small talk
Say nice things
Maybe get her FB/number
The important thing is keep the conversation flowing
Like ask her what department she's in or something. Be like oh I see you everyday at this stop, im person_378, what's your name?
first things first. how to approach her. do I like just randomly go up and talk or should I be like oh hey would it be cool if I sat here.
If it's at the stop, just walk up to her and be like hey I see you every T-Th, do you go to the same school as me?
*Tues-Thurs
Not the crying face
Well she gets on at the stop after mine
Then talk to her when she gets on
Just say the same thing
Just don't act nervous, people don't really care if you just walk up to them and talk assuming you aren't a creep or are soliciting
Like I talked to the lady on my flight to location_17 for like 5 hours before I passed out
Oh wow. I guess I could introduce myself and shiz. I just don't wanna make it seem awkward someone just randomly coming up and talking to you.
If you think that way it all becomes awkward
Just make it natural
You can learn enough from the small talk usually to keep things going
ah. main issue for me is finding a way to talk without being weird
You just have to be yourself
Talk how you normally would to me, person_379, family, other friends
oop. tomorrow
ohhhhhh I think I misread your message heh. Did you mean dinner today and info session tomorrow?
*interview
my brain is mush right now
Oh lol uhh idk could we do that? :P
Well the interview thing is just 30min so maybe we could do it today?
Before dinner?
mm ok. I told person_187 I'd get dinner with him tonight but maybe I can meet up with him after?
Oh lol hold on I'm kinda confused :P
So ur having dinner with person_496?
haha ahh he and I briefly talked about it earlier, but it was kinda spontaneous so maybe I can eat with you instead
Ohh lol brb
haha kk. sorry for da confusion
Umm if u have time tomorrow it's fine if u eat dinner with person_496 tonight hah
Haha
haha okee. are you free tomorrow @time_1 ish?
Yes!
Oh what r the owo events tomorrow? Cause I'd like to help out :D if that's ok lol
there's smores at 4:30 and pancakes at 10! But you might want to ask person_188
I have no idea
Depends on course
But generally all the waitlists clear
So no need to worry about that
that is good to know :)
hey so theres a course at silicon valley..Data intensive workflow for software engineers
any idea on that?
Shoot it's  $1.75 T^T
Do u have a quarter??
Let me check
I think I have like 1
Ya that's good
Also idk if u wanna just open the windows cause it feels pretty cool outside
Rain..?
Is it raining rn?
Yea
Wait r u coming to give me the 25 lol
Crap it's a Canadian quarter idk if it'll work
Lol
Hahahaha omg
Umm could we ask one of the guys..
Mmmm ....
Lol what's that
I'm asking person_488
Hold on
Oh ok
He should be on his way
Yayyy
Of course
You look lovely :)
But if you dont like it I won't
I think it's fine
I'll be upstairs soon
Ok.

What kind of puppy?
We're not sure yet

you dont remember? </3
I was probably drunk or high or mentally impaired 
I wager the last one 
I have class soon :( 
Is jouni our last participant ? 
mentally immpaired? LOL
i think so?
i think we should user test normal people too
like friends
Yeah my roommate and friend want to do it. I'll get to it soon 
cool you are on top of your hsit
I wish 
I've been procrastinating all week
I should have finished my decision analysis report day_1 but now I have to cram it today
There's also a document I wanna finish before our client meeting 
Ugh I have a phone interview at time_1 tomorrow so I might have to run away from our meeting toward the end
Lyfe is sad
U make me smile tho <3 
:c not gonna see this ass for 3 months
Were you seeing his ass before o.O
Omg not like that. 
Although his PJs do show it off. 
Aww, you still sleep with your clothes on
I mean, he only wears pants. Did you sleep with yours off?
Depends on the weather, usually I just wear underwear but sometimes nothing feels good
But it was more of a joke about the both of you sleeping with your clothes on
I know :P
Being naked doesn't have to be sexual
Nope. But it's weird. 
You just have to get used to it
Although I guess dicks are gross, weird, and scary
 You have to realise I don't want the feel of the stuff on my skin
What stuff?
It's like how I always wear a bra to sleep even though most people don't. 
Like sheets and blanket 
And if he were naked, I wouldn't care lol
Sometimes try not doing it, it can be empowering
I ran into person_189 omw to mw btw
what happened?
Here's a portion of our conversation:/nperson_189: Where are you headed?/nMe: To Morewood./nperson_189: To work?/nMe: No, my girlfriend lives there./nperson_189: You have a girlfriend?
Me: I do now.
crap....
he reacts worse than me
person_189: *pauses*
and im kidding lol
person_189: Please tell me it's not person_190
...
he's obssessed with her i tell you
Hey it would have fit
She would have continued around the circle
Everything's so quiet rn
Meaning person_44's asleep and I'm the only one on the Minecraft server
oh the one with person_346?
Yeah what's he doing lol
lolol

I need to like figure out if it becomes a real thing
because if it is then my future is set as hell
Heh
Do we have chem recitation

If not I'll sacrifice day_1 lecture
i dont think i did very welll
Lol
answer key is up
btw
Wait....
What?!?!
Dang
That means they're almost done with grades
I don't want to look at it
Hopefully curve is nice
There will be a curve.. Right?
hopefully
idk
If it is raw score, then I may have to consider other career options just in case
me too
hey
there?
i saw the email
the first one is the same one where i was living
in mountain view
it was sexy
it is kinda far from my place
Lol
Check Sunnyvale
I feel it's not close to shuttle stops
Let's look at this in evening when you break or something?
yes
yeah i saw
its not very close to the shuttle thing
but lets check in evening
Also I'll ask person_371 to help me find shuttle routes if I can't find by then
I have to respond in 24 hours so let's not forget 
yes
L m a o
It is
Godbless
oh yea cuz weekend before finals week
wow haha
Also that fucking twerk thing gained a good amount more attention then it should have hahahaha
oh yea hahaha
also some guy basically said the same thing as u in dutch or german or something
Yeah I saw it afyer and I was like awkward
wut what
u should sue them
haha for what?
offending my taste buds
what if u were allergic
that could've killed u
will you be my lawyer
u dont want me as ur lawyer
Weren't the courts like 1600
Do we still have something like 2k?
Yeah
the courts have been paid for
$1,567.84
we have
Oh well if they forgot about something
It'll just roll over :D
And we'll need it
lol yeah
for transport
but i feel like we're forgetting something
Also don't we need to submit a roll over form? I think that was over the summer though
Well it doesn't matter
We have $1000 buffer
haha (y)
and worst comes to worse
if we forgot
We'll just charge everyone 10 or something
for the dinner
i think it also auto rollsover or somethign
i was just lookinga ti ti
oh gift account balance auto rolls over
but yeah applications for rollover is in june
Haha hopefully!
but are you thinking of going back to sg after grad?
I wanna work here for OPT first
My parents don't want me to
Lol
eh true la
OPT is good
Yea man
hmm, do you think you can convince them to be alright with that?'
you applied organization_36 for summer alr right?
Plus so much easier to earn back the money here
Yup!
Err the first time I mentioned OPT my dad was quite angry, but now I think they're kinda resigned to it lol
I said it's 1 year lol didn't dare to mention the extension ._.
I just met person_191
God fucking dammit
How
He was having a smoke out back
person_192
Lucky sob
Is he as chill as he seems?
Yes
Fug
Dude I still can't believe that happened
I called him Mr. person_193
Oh god I'm sorry but why
I dunno, heat of the moment mang
When was person_194 ever in a favorable meta
When we had less control decks.
Which was?
Set 1-2 had DotX, set 3 had Revengers (and not enough NN support), 4 the same(but more NN support), 5 had CBD, 6 made Ahsha decent, 7 had person_195
I'll give you that 7 was probably the most favorable meta
Cause 7 allowed the deck to play defensively
I'm grouping the FC with 7
I mean FC didn't really do anything for NN.
G guard
organization_37, person_196
location_42 in it of itself
Name_1 sure I'll give you, but the crays didn't really do anything for NN either.
Dizmel helps lol
No one runs person_197 in NN.
location_42 fixes the entire GB2 problem
The fact that you have G guardians helps
It's not like the deck draws a shit ton
I think I have a solid C on it
(y)
:D
I need help on v0cm
*c0vm
I'm going to go drop in at person_165's for a little bit and then I'll come down to you
Unless you're in the cluster in which case I'll come to the cluster
i'm outside at the lounge
person_165 got a 0 on proxy so it's safe to say he's failing 213
person_361 and person_450 is out there doing 3d
Lol
shittyy :O
that's really shitty
sad
Yeah gotta make sure he's not drinking his sorrows away
:O
will he be fine though
as in academic-wise
Considering he failed each concepts and 150 once, he's probably going to have to do some summer classes or do a part time semester 
And maybe he'll have academic probation next semester
:O
 Lol okl
Are you walking?  
/which door should I meet you at    
There are multiple doors? I've never been to location_98
Yay can I see your apt
What didn't you come for organization_38 things?  
Last year 
Nope lol
And uhh sure but person_198 has his stuff all over the floor bc he's working on his computer lol 
And I gotta get back to work but you can come for like 10 mins lol
Are you walking or bussing? 
Walking 
Ok turn right at location_1 and location_2 then and I'll come meet you
It's one after person_199
We need a gift for person_200
Someone suggest idea
LoL omg yes
Do you have prime?
I do
But
that mug doesn't seem to be prime eligible
This does
nvm
that isn't eligible either
There's a normal mug that is I think
yeah
Should I get it?
i'm shopping for more makeup oh god
I haven't been to uniqlo in like a week
i didn't bring any skincare stuff with me because the bottles were too big to fly with and now i regret everything
i just want to buy
stuff
r u still in location_43
YOU COULD STILL GO
Yes
I could
hmmmmmmmm
Ohhhhhh
All the best person_396 ;)
U'll crck it bro :D
*crack
Fuck off I didn't 😏
I did well only daa
whaaat
u did well, but still didnt get selected? :/
Don't know where I would have made mistakes
For text classification as in? What I used for mltm?
Yeah
Actually for that we didn't use any library functions
We implemented it all ourselves
Hmm 
Have you worked with any libraries anyways?
I think svms do well on text
For 601, that's it
Hmm okay
Yeah on text, for classification, multiclass svm and logistic should be decent.. What's your classification problem?
For person_201
It's a 2 class classification task
Here we're just classifying sentences 
Not even documents
Hmmm.. So we had a similar problem for mltm, logistic regression gave 60%.. But that was 5 classes, and that was not the standard library function..
If it's two classes, and if you use sklearn, it'll definitely be much better
And you can try svms too, if your data won't be linearly separable
Which it probably won't since it's text
You can use kernels
Yeah that's why I guess they say generally svms do well
Sure, I can get it to you for that. How are you going to pay? Cash or Venmo?
Venmo would be easier.
Is the chair okay though? Good for use?
Because I got a chair from someone and it's old and the springs have gone bad and it can't be used.
I wouldn't sell it if it wasn't. It just has one level
So you can't go up and down
Okay. That isn't an issue.
When you sit on it goes down a notch to the only level that works.
It works well and moves well
No issues
Alright then. That's great!
I have several other request too so let me know if you are having second thoughts
No I just wanted to confirm.
Okay cool.
I'll be home till 2:45PM
Dont worry I'm not into scamming people
Just trying to downsize
Haha. Okay. I'll take your word for it.
So my address is 5562 location_44.
Omg loool
is that why he almost dated person_465
Probably
Korean girls try to eat less
So there are more blocks for him to take
loool
i havent eaten that much recerntly
i went to location_97 yesterday!
lol
thats why he took name_1 as name_2
truth
i wanted to get the huge margaritas from location_97
that are so cheap
but i went past 12
LOL
:(
Ohhhhhh
I see I see
And professors are poor too haha
They need all the help they can get
its more like
our meeting every week, we order drinks, so then them money in the pot is used for stuff like this LOL
for lab activitie
s
hey person_180, did you take any of the dishes/bowls by any chance?
Loll no...
lol ok....
i don't know where they went..
Oh no!! :(
:( so once my security deposit comes in, i'll charge u for the june & july water bill & return ur $50 security deposit!
Ok! Oh I thought I paid for water on June?
it was june electric u paid for~
cus i never got the water bill for june & july in the mail before i moved out!
Ohh lol okk
Btw I forgot to show you earlier but this is what person_202 had to say about you lol
LOL

Cool

There you have it
At least one of my friends approves of you 
yayy
Are you ok
Legs are wet
Oh person_362 is horny
Feet aren't bc my boots
No
That would be very hentai if i dripped all the way to my legs
Yes
Bag front pocket soaked thru bc i left the zipper open wtf
person_117 is here
Hi person_385
Thermodynamics review
We drew 1-1
Have to win away
Found out my cloth pencil case is waterproof
Bc the cushiony part makes sure water won't reach innards
Nice
Yeaa lol
Don't worry he only does it around certain people
Which doesn't include you
Or person_30
Who knows what happens in that house lol
It doesn't include person_30 because person_30 could punch him
Why dont you punch him then lol
I'm too nice
And person_30's punches hurt more
His arm is bigger
You need to be like person_360
Do you eveb lift bro
Lol no
 you have to
person_165 doesn't
I'm more fit than person_165
Therefore I can physically fend off naked person_165 if necessary
d
Lol wrong emoni
Emoji
person_203
Well what's the right emoji
=1=1=1
Lol why
shit I need to go to the lab tonight
bf1 beta is live
WERE person_204
Is it open?
I believe so
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
It's not completely open until tomorrow
Only those who were sent codes today can play
I have 2 emails with access keys so
Dibs
Thank goodness
does anyone know if the showcase will have food (like dinner), or do I need to eat beforehand?
There is food, yeah. Also, you should ideally come an hour or so early for setup.
If you got the email from person_205, etc.
Actually, we have setup from 3-5 technically.
well, I literally just need to plug my laptop in
but 3-5 is the student showcase, correct?
You aren't an ETC person, obviously. >:o
We gotta theme the room.
uh, how?
That's up to us.
but like what do we have to work with?
giant inflatable chess pieces or something?
lol
Not sure. We have a sign. And cardboard. And we have to coordinate our schedules.
So the room is never abandoned.
If I were you, I'd get here early, but only maybe like time_1.
Lest you get the crappy shift.
well, the shuttle would arrive at 4, but ok
Sorry, this is only the second year they've had a spring showcase, so everyone's a little unclear on what's going on.
np
You good?
I am not sure
i just looked at the code
android studio is funny is giving me errors
i dont see any place for user profile
i am assuming i will have to make new activity and stuff
New blank activity. Read user data from the intent bundle to populate the profile.
Change the onclicklistener in FriendRecycler...Adapter
to put the dummy item in a bundle and start a new intent with your activity and the bundle
hahaa thanks thanks lol
it's gonna be so long
Haha can one!
What time does it start?
haha 615
then they cut us off at 10
person_206
Exam till 10
That's crazy
yeah it's kinda long
.....
need to get good rest for it
planning on taking a nap later hehe
LOL
i would be more concerned about food
the exam is over dinner!!!
Dude they apparently take blood samples
for which one or both of them?
The Kool aid
But apparently you just give blood twice
oh yeah
Idk they said the meetings last 5 hours
and like really bad
oh fuck
like on weekends?
I guess
But its 300 in 10 hours
30 bucks an hour
that's still hella good
I said I was interested
Cause the rest is drinking Kool aid they give you for 12 weeks
And urine samples
lol i might do it
I think theyre the same thing
Lol
Actually nvm
There is one that gives you 240 bucks (40 bucks per 30 minutes) but you need to get ear nerves severed....
Like wth
I think I just found the greatest subreddit of all time
link_13
I don't get it
Is it like disproving stuff that gets to the frontpage?
Never mind, I think I follow
location_16 is a strange and vast place
It tells you the point of clickbait articles without having to waste time
Yeah, I clicked the Grilled Cheese one
They spent a bunch of time talking about Boy Scouts
And more talking about different professors
Turns out grilled cheese lovers don't have better sex
Learn something new every day
I'm sorry
I miss you too
The cookies didn't come out well at al
my mom likes them
i'd give them a 4/10
lol why not?
What'd you do wrong?
i don't know
i just might not like the recipe, but i could have taken them out too early
they're too light
Lol
It's probably mostly the recipe
mhm
i could bring you some tomorrow
i also got a little burn on my wrist
Oh no
i couldn't find an oven mitt
potholders aren't the same
Lol yeah they are
But I'm sorry
it's nbd
Tomorrow?
i'll need to figure out how much stuff I need to do
brb
dude, i'm in a study right now
and i got a free fitbit charge hr
to track steps
and potentially 200 bucks at the end
Wtf
you can have it when you come over for thanksgiving
Can I take part in a razer book, keyboard, mouse, and headset study?
LOL
:^)
i just need to wear it for 50 days for them to track it
Nah you can use it
dude, i already have miband
no need
Same tho
Idk well see
kk
Hey can you send me the kickboxing details?. One I see online was $77
I just sent a request to the moderator to add you to the facebook group
Its not exactly kickboxing
Its organization_39
Ah ok
this is an old message but this sem's schedule isn't updated yet on the group
:)
I can just go to the class with you then
yuzz
Even if I'm not in the group
Fb group
nothings posted there yet about this sem
so lets see :)
Ok
:)
group x schedule is out na
diid you check?
am checking right now
Oh I'll check
Well yeah And doesnt
Lol its funny how you're doing Or and And and how I've been doing NOR and NAND gates
What's that?
Not or and Not And
OH lol
so the values that don't fall into their range I'm guessing
You can do any operation using OR and AND
They do
NOR and NAND can do anything lol
But it's not simple like OR and AND
It's a boolean statement
Wtf
Like NAND and NOR have truth tables
So do OR and AND but it's a bit different from what you're doing
Oh I see
Interesting
Like it's really the same, but you're doing ranges im doing truth statements
You know volunteer judges have next to no power lol.
I mean floor judges still can make a decision
Like if the HJ here fucks up (which I have yet to see lol) then that's on them, but there's not much you can do other than see the fucking  up happening lol.
And provide proof
You're right.
Not much otjer than seeing it happen like I said lol.
But again, assuming they dont call head judge, it's usually Will right? The floor judge makes said call
And I know the HJ in location_45 is good. We probably have one of if not the best run regional in the world
But id rather contribute to making it even minorly better than playing and doing nothing at all
And its not like this was on a whim, I thought about doing the same for Team League but I got pressured into playing
Yeah assuming they don't call HJ, it's all you. It rotates from WIll and like 1 or 2 other people. And fair enough lol
Plus I havent made a final decision on it yet, probably will in the next week or so. But how do I sign up?
Should've killed him
OMG LOL
Don't be killing off the hot stuff. 
He has boots. For movement. 
LOL
He's very useful. 
I read that 4koma
u w u
The one you sent to me right? It pains me that there is no lonqu esque character in fates I can ship person_486 with
I know oh my god
Do you feel my pain
Me
You would just instantly marry them
Yea
Yes
I have like so many husbandos in fates
But none can replace person_429
I can't find any girls I really like in birthright, but too many male choices. Haven't even started other paths yet, oops. 
Is person_207 not close to person_429?
Well in looks, definitely not. In personality, pretty close I'd say. person_430 as well. Actually person_430 is more like person_431 than person_207. person_207 is much more openly caring and well, BROTHERLY
But they're all different :c
I like person_432 a lot cuz he reminds me of person_433 from organization_80
But... No one is like person_429 truly...
Oh shit babe
Fuck me
Yes ma'am
PS I'm so stressed about being preggo again 
Cause I've been feeling so shit 
Babe!!!
Noooo
And stomsche pains 
And nausea 
Oh no hunny
Go to health services pls
Pretty please
Y
With lots of cherries on top
Can't they check for u
Idk
But it only checks after you've had it a while
R u sure
They know the symptoms tho
Yeah 
Better start saving money
Fml y would u be preggo tho
Cause having sex without a condom is very risky 
yeah wtf why he so genius
what's the point of having big forehead if i'm not geinus
idk
poor babby
but you are genius
how??
the way my prof draws zener diodes he makes them look practically like swastikas and it makes me lowkey uncomfortable
but you love germany
i hate nazis
oh :C
person_362 hates me :C
will you are not a nazi
oh ok good
but i like person_464 and he is socialist and nazis were national socialist party so therefore i am nazi
i don't think it works that way
are you sure
yes
ok good
i do but of the colors that are available
there is nothing i like
ok lemme look again
I'm getting echo park
hmm i was thinking that
but i kinda want botanical
summery~
take chi out
and replace with what
im thinking
what would look better on me
botanical
or echo
also i realized i'm $1 away from free shipping
lol
rip
get brow pencil or somethin
i already got one lol
do i get echo or botanical
lip god tell me
get botanical for me
Also is this through CU? Cause I have store credit
If it is I can give it to person_494
Naw it's my friends deck lol
What does he want for it
And does he want CU store credit? Cause I ended up with too much lol
I think he just wants organization_40 that's all he asked me to get
Kk, how much?
Or I could ask person_438, its his deck right?
He wanted me to deal with it lol but he said he wants at least 350
Seems steep
Ill think about it and get back to you lol
We priced it out and it over 500 lol
Ohhh shit
im thinking about organization_41 Center/location_1 Application
anything special about that place?
why did you choose it
boston is a diverse place, and ___medical center attracts many people and cases
just that its a medical center
as opposed to idk homeless
"world class"
dude, choose one that you have a reason to choose
what reason would you have for choosing any
i would only choose like the last one because i was obese before
Hmm what is the whole point
Of the second week
Don't we already have our product after the first week
Hmm
Maybe to re purify it?
I know we need to use it to do other reactions
Ok
Yeah, that's why we leave it in the watch glad
Glass
Also
You put the overall transformation reaction in
The objective right
I didn't
Hmm yeah I think that'll be necessary two weeks down the line
And one more thing.. They give mass ranges for what you should add
Did you include the mass range and then included a blank box
For your mass
Nah, just the blank
Or did you just include a blank box for your mass of reagent
Ok
Yo I might send you my CU store credit to give to person_208 if I buy his GC lot
Nah
He's not selling it for CU
Yeha he told me :/
Yeah that's organization_42 deck
What am I supposed to do with 90 store credit lol
Ohhhh
If this was the shops deck
Would you have bought it lol
Did you take person_209's shift so that she could go to the athletics banquet??
Idk
I just left the athletic banquet early
It doesn't matter
I got my cheesecake that's all that matters lol
I just wish u could've heard coach speak
*i
LOL. CHEESECAKE YEA
What was his speech?
Idk I couldn't stay until his turn
Oh wait

Oh thanks lol

2. i sound like person_383
i think im going to leave it up there
Hey person_77,/nIt is a similar room now as on the picture as the land lord decided to rent out a room downstairs first. But the pro is: it is only shared with one other person and even as big. It goes for 925$/month too. Gas, electricity, water, all kitchenstuff and furnished included
I made a video of the entire apartment For another girl who was interested... If you want I can send it to you or else we can organization_43 tomorrow and I show you :)
If you would like it then I just forward you the email address of the landlady and you can deal your move in and out and the payment with her../nUsually she asks for $200 reservation fee, that you have to provide via organization_40 for example upfront that she is sure that you take the room
hi! yup, it would be great if you could send that video to me (:
also, could i have the address of the place? bed-stuy is a bit big!
haha thanks!
Thats all. The adress is location_95. The apartment is the one on the first floor
On google streetview you can see that there is all stuff around (fast food, deli, supeemarket close etc)
ok! let me check out the videos!
haha its very much appreciated!
will the landlady return the reservation fee?
Normaly no. I had to pat it nonrefundable
ahh
Pay* like my roommates
im on a really tight budget and im a bit worried that the additional $200 might make me go over
hmm
could i get the landlady's email to check with her directly?
thank you so much!
you've been really helpful (:
Sure! Its person_210
person_437@yahoo.com
thank you!
very much appreciated!

Like it's honestly exactly what I wanted
Wait are we talking about radiohead or bottomless pit
Physical instrumentation with thom's electronic sensibilities
Oh yeah
Ok I'm talking person_212
I agree with you still
Just with less excitement
What did you link? I just figured that it was person_212
It's radiohead
Lol
Lol ok
Lol
but yeah, gonna give bp a listen later
Damn though I need that new organization_45 record if it's got more shit like this on it
We watched a YouTube ad for some new chicken sub at Subway
I forget what it was

I'm home now
Because I took the car today
:D
but how are your parents going to go back home :O
I'll have to go pick them up lol

My mom gets off at like 5
My dad takes the T to the closest station and then we pick him up from there

I want to drive
Lol
It's fun
It was 5 times faster than taking the bus
Literally
lolll niceeee
alright, i'm thinking we might want to have a new base plate
shouldn't be too terrible
Sorry about the like lol. 
like?
Do w3 n33d a whole new plate?  Or just new holes? 
btw
LOL
wtf
3?
i'm thinking new plate might not be the worst thing
it'll get auto set up with the drilling op
i need the 3/8 hole to be like 6  inches from the first quarter hole
so, i think a new plate is the way to go
btw
just talked to person_467
keep it on the dl
poster is NOT graded
Oh cool... and good good. Are we not supposed to know that it's not graded?
well it isn't on the syllabus
but if ppl assume it's graded, then they'll probably try harder right?
idk
but, he suggested largely having stufff from the pt 1 and pt 2
just to show the progression, vs the final model
i was in the UC w my umbrella and i was like "this is fine i have an umbrella" and then walked like 10 feet into the rain and was like "nope nvm"
im hiding out in location_1 now
i wanted to get groceries damnit
my socks are wet
:(((((((
sad boi
:(
i love thunder tho
the cut is turning into a pond
lol n o p e

I mean like I'm not terrified of it
But it's one of those fears that never went away
omg there are people frolicking in the cut pond
So every time it thunders it's like "G R E A T"
If I had a poncho
I would so do that
in their sports bras
and gym shorts
SOMEONE GIVE ME A SPORTS BRA

Yo I have a bit of time if you're trynna run something on destiny 
Or another game 
I'm actually pretty beat right now; probably headed to sleep in about half an hour
No worries dude 
I'm down to play tomorrow if you want though
For sure I'll let you know 
Also when are you free this week?
Most days after 2, hbu? 
Literally until June 13, I have like no plans
person_213 yer
I'm hype brah this summer is gonna be dope
Yeah dude, I'm so glad that I have some time to decompress and chill with y'all
And there's some new shit to do in York to boot
Yeah?
Hookah bar, cool resteraunts, an arcade in location_46 
Oh yo, that's awesome
We gotta check that shit out
I thought he was seeing person_214 or something
Ohhh lol
He's meeting anyone that basically messaged him
I just saw him at person_215 hall tho
Hahahaha chernobyl
Are you still in debate
Yeah dude
Y
Cause like person_30 is too right
That came up
Yeah person_216's partner cuz person_217 randomly wanted to
Yeah, person_218 was kinda confused
That is very weird
Or maybe I'll feel it
Like leia
The force isn't real though
Are you sure
Pretty sure
Oh
person_219 got double force punch bc her son killed her husband
Right
That's different than just her husband dying
Yes
So person_370 would have to be driving the bus
Oh
person_220 is my son
Yes oh wait he's not mine
It'll be cool to see person_370 driving, like those Toyota commercials
Yes
Very cute
The puppy in the booster chair
Remember
Yes
person_221
hey you available right now?
yes
cool I'll be there in 15
ok
hey
just to clarify tha apartment is available from may 17 to july 31
that is okay with you right?
...
we can discuss details in person
would I be able to move my shit in advance?
no :(
and pile it up in a closet or something?
our house is gonna be pretty full for the commencement
commencement?
graduation
i guess i could keep a bag or so
but not much
nah I got a lot
I'll have to talk to housing services to see if I can keep the room for a couple days longer
but for now I'll check out the room
okay
And the qrop node is connected to the mantra at render?
Yep I've got the process mastered haha verifies, send job, python loads, opens file, fails at render
Do you at least get a note saying the render failed from person_222?
It gets stuck in an infinite loop of attempting the mantra node, then qube blocks it. Tested with a regular project file and an extremely simple ome
My job logs are on the network if you want to investigate
hmm it only has so much info. I know mine failed before when i didnt have all the directories pointing to the $HIP file
like everything including materials and the out images need to be $HIP and then when you submit, the $hip needs to be in the z drive
mine would fail if like one material wasn't formatted like that so i had to go through all of them to find the culprit
Had everything pointed to hip as well, same with on my mapped drive
even everything in the mantra node is $HIP?
mmhmm!
I checked literally everything haha
okay also in the qrop node, do you have the build minor thing selected
yes match minor allow any
hmmmmmm
e-mailed person_223 cook last night, no response. I know person_224 is getting very agitated about it so we'll see where it goes
are you currently in the lab? i can stop by and take a look if you have the time
but if its anything outside the documentation i won't be much help. I can just empathize because i too was pulling my hair out about this a few weeks ago
it is definitely outside documentation considering I had to text edit the config myself haha. I'm on my way to pickup a project for class at 3:30 so earliest I could try again is 4:30
ah no worries, im leaving around 4. but next time you're working on it I can try and help or at least see what's going on and try to communicate it to the higher ups. It's not really my job but I want people have to render farm haha
to have*
Same here. Not knowing who is responsible makes this way worse
You found two subletters right ?
yeah
Are they here the whole summer?
june through early august
So that's 2 month?
yeah
Cuz some Chinese girl asking if we still have room
we have 1
And she here the whole summer
i think person_381 is staying
so person_381   my people can grab the hallways rooms
oh wait
So I'll say yes and show her the house and see whether she wants the house
another issue is our lease says april
what ami saying
our lease starts june*
and idk when the poeple in there are moving ou
so if shes fine crashing at our current place (328) for a bit
bc korea
they censor tattoos too sometimes
all the times
Wtf
Even raven tattoos
Why asia so conservative 
uh it's korea
idk what they're doing
it's actually funny to me sometimes
in random videos when some criminal takes out a tiny swiss army knife and it's blurred out
yet guns are not blurred at all?
Very bizarre
just like in that commercial my friend was talking about the knife the chef was holding was fine but as soon as he threw it into a cutting board and it stuck there, it has to be blurred lol
So weird
lol
so slow at my hw
keep on taking mini breaks
ow i accidentally scratched a pimple type thing really roughly and i teared up it smarted so bad
Smarties
I'll have to read about it tomorrow
word
I just needed to speak to someone because it was all amounts of ??????
You can tell it was rushed
/less care given
Because loksat was implied to be a massively powerful organization so it makes no sense that they'd be taken down in one episode
and that it was one person?
Also, taking them down by tracing a cell phone? amateur mistake
Also, organization_46 literally had no business helping them only to betray them later, other than finding out who else knew
Also how she like, figured it out just like that? pretty intense
I mean she was suspicious
true
When he first helped her, it's why she took the gun
and just not logical. I mean, why did he stage a save? While letting a bunch of people died.
I just don't know
Electromagnet ceiling
what
DISGUSTING!!!!!
MY GOD
I am that cat tho
Will doesn't like my love
wtf your suitemates
I feel so bad for person_489
person_225's reputation just tanked
should i send her an angry facebook message
Yes lmao
That would be so funny
i dont  think i ever  spoke to her though
Lmao
she was the sister of one of my classmates
i'm going to ask her why she throws up in showers
she is person_387 lavelle, correct?
Yeah lmao
 Is this too mean
i dont care
youre the one that has to live next to her though so if she gets upset you're the one paying for it, not me
No not a lawyer to be
What you do today
I slept
Watched game
Sleepy
Slept
I meant
Now I hungry
I sore
When did world war z take place
Why no twitter and instagram
When the book was written I guess
Everyone's like yeah we didn't believe blah blah had happened
It was written in 2006
So 10 years ago
Oh that makes more sense
Okie! I should be able to make it
Hahaha and yeah I'll try asking buggy people
To play test your game
awesome!
thank you :D
When is the next one?
not sure yet!
need to check the actors schedule
Kk
thanks haha
My snaps will attract a lot of people I think
oh yes and DONT TELL person_417 we're celebrating her birthday
its a surprise
person_226
haha yea i know, thats why i asked you :P
And I don't talk to her that much
ok so i just got the actors schedule
so our next playtest is this thu 7pm
can take the 645 shuttle
Ok I'll tell my friends!
thanks!!
my phone is being impertinent, what i showed you is nothing, just a practice piece, but with inlay you can make things like these
I like the vase!
Can I request a small flower vase for when you become good at it?
my dad's thinking about getting a lathe because it'd be fun to have, if he does and if I can gain proficiency then yes.
that's more of what i should be able to do right not
now
hopefully
if i stop messing it up
That's pretty. I liked the box lid in the group of photos u sent. So like a cutting board/pot holder looking piece of wood. A big table top would be beautiful and unique!
mhmm. don't know that ill have the opportunity to make anything right away, but i thought that it looked like a cool skill to develop
Mhm. If u become artsy you could make some pretty things. You'll have to tell me how it works tmrw
woodworking is my artistic expression.
hey about web app dev..did u take it in fall or spring? i heard its dificult to get in spring
web is tough to get in anyway
apply in both sem

It is good. if you have no idea about web dev
otherwise it not so great
yeah very less idea about webdev
im number_1 on wl now
but it doesnt fit wuthn my overall course plan..i'd prefer it in spring
Yeah.. Taking cloud is  a good idea
it'll help you in internship hunt also
m just kinda confused about the mobile track courses..as of now i've decided /npervasive sem 1/nweb app dev sem 2/nmobile service innovation sem 2/ngadgets sensors and activity recongniton sem 2
Patch days are normally tuesdays

Hey
So I'm looking for a place in city_1
Did you find any place?
Nope. Going to start looking
Are you planning to stay in NJ or NYC?
I'm preferring city_1
Where is your office
NYC. Vesey street
Downtown
Yours?
avenue_1
I've found a place in location_51. Actually a friend has told me of this place
What dates are you looking for the acco for?
And what is the rent?
date_1 to date_2
What about you?
The rent of the apart is 1600 but m open to other options too
I'll need from June 6th to August 12th
Ohk
1600 for a 1bhk?
Yeah
Ohh okay. Thanks!
Is it one of these?
No mo
It's kept apart, a single one
The cover is worn out a bit, it's a spring kind of Mattress
They did some repair work in the basement. Theyve moved stuff around. I think theyve even hauled away some stuff.
Whats the color?
Supposed to be off white
About 6 inches thick
With springs. If it isn't there, then they probably trashed it
Ok so thats probaby the last one in the pic. Ill send u a pic of that mattress alone. See if you can identify it
I guess it's the third one in the pic
Have a look at it again
Yup third one
It has some flower designs and stuff
Yes that's  the one
Yup. I'll clean it. You want it? Whom are you buying for?
For myself actually. The mattresses i had in my room are actually person_231's. The previous tenant
Sure. Ill take it. Its better than letting it stay in the basement. Are you charging anything for it?
What's your offer
Im not too sure. Actually i was looking for a softer mattress without springs. The bed i have has a spring mattress in it already
Two others have offered a softer mattress. Ill just talk to them and get back to you
person_232 what did u send me
is this a joke?
real funny
oh wait what
awk sorry
all my server/ui files are named the same thing must have sent the wrong one
i just sent you the right ones
kk
Wat about it ra
Seems simple
You've done it?
Did the first part. Determining number. 
Did you get 5 for sample a?
The last portion should be similar
Yeah
I got 5 but I can't zoom in to the plot like they want 
I used scatter for finding number :P
The 2 peaks
Haha why, just use xlim ylim
What's that
Limits the x and y axis range
That way you zoom in
Oh I see

It is weird they don't do net ionic
Reactions
wait, that's what i did
is that why it's wrong?
You gotta write it all out
Even the species
That cancel out
I think
have you tried it yet, or is that just waht you've heard
i'll try it
and on the products side
can i write ions?
for example, should i write Na+ + NO3- or NaNO3
since NaNO3 would be very soluble in water
No nociel no suriel
U have 1 nociel
It's a stired
I mean I dont need to put Nociel or Suriel
Oh okay
This is making a deck for a friend

Let's drop out
Work at the zoo
With the bears

that sounds so ideal
I know right
You probably need some kind of degree for that though
creo is so stupid
yeah something that needs bio
i suck at bio
Yeah bio is too much chemistry
no it's too much cycles
Chemical cycles
what is the official advantage to having more turbine blades in an engine
so like more blades on a single fan?
yeah
or having many fans in an engine
oh
no like blades
i guess more surface area makes bigger pressure drop
does that mean more power out
i guess
oh
How long till you're done?
i'll probably be working til midnight
711/1500
Halfway

It'll be worth it bro
The effort you put in now will carry you for the rest of your life
I want that, but also I plan on going back to school at some point for more degrees
Well shit if that's what you wanna do bruh
Once I'm done in done
It depends on how much of my idealism I can hold onto through this process.  I'd like to come back for a masters in computer engineering and at least a bachelors in physics
That's commendable bruh, your goal is knowledge
I'm just greedy and want paper ~~
one of my friends needs to buy food from giant eagle so don't feel forced to come lol
Ahahaha okay :)

I'm talking with person_461 today about some things about running for manager next year
Talk to meZz
I was a manager you clown
I was gonna talk with person_461 cuz he will More than less likely be involved with exec next year
K
But a good idea, I'd texted organization_50 and he didn't respond 
You down to talk at some point? 
Sure
You need to do this stuff earlier though
Tomorrow is deadline
Yeah I know, dies later tonight work? 
Lol
>> idk
I'm already sleepy...
Lollll
U've been taking naps in the middle of the day so that makes sense :P
U still eating?
Omw home
I'm just gonna showerand sleep...
Wait what
So we're moving things once I get back?...
Did u get me food??
Yes I did
Ahhhh idk maybe I'll nap until you're bk then?
yayy :D
ok lol
umm do u wanna try moving come things onto person_412's desk?
or we can move some things together cause I'll be here till around 8:45
Can I rest for a bit firs
uhh r u really tired? cause I'd rather get some things moved first and then finish when I get back
I don't wanna end up sleeping too late lol
Mhmm
But I'm super exhausted
so basically whats happening is theyre splitting the manager role up into two things,  2 people doing strictly logistics and then 2 people doing managing campus
and i was considering running for the current manager role, and i talked with people and they generally recommended that I run for the logistics role (because my dancing isnt up to par where it should be), as opposed to the new campus role
and im not sure the it would be worth strictly doing bitch work
Ah I gotcha 
That's tough 
I guess the question is, what's your reason for running? 
honestly i love dancing and i love working with new people
Might be easier to chat over phone. Can I call you in half hour 
yeah should be good
Alright 
my numbers 4085070023
Perfect 
dope
Talk soon 
yeee
hahaha
I mean...
hahaha
if he's unsuccessful
then no
you used to be around peopel with more skill and will and didn't really get more will haha
eh not so much on the will front
!
I can't really think of many
i feel like my skill/will balance is quite atypical
hmm
??
so he has the most will out of anyone you worked with?
is he working on something right now lol?
yea his africa distillery
i dont thnk 'most'
but definitely more
hmm ever lived with then haha

At least you're not playing on a mac

Did you get an achievement

Alright person_392...

i don't want to beat him up
I kind of want to beat him up
I WANT
Lol
organization_51
walmart is too far away
Yes I know
I'm sure they have honey mustard at organization_52

Lol
Are you going to start cooking

and idk why i had actual dreams for once
did you do drugs
no :(
I wonder if i'm going to change sizes in the next 2 years
i'll just lazy it up and only eat the free food
lmao
i'm trynna lose weight, you're keeping up with the high waist traditions
i meant it more so that i wont go shopping
and ... walking to and fro
and corporate presentations and b**rs
so minimal food
gotta lose around 45 lbs in 6 months
and i gotta find a way
your index finger
why does every meal always come with a fucking drink
y not water
there was water today :P
at beers?
mmhm
lol, meaning i may actually start coming for beers lolz
Yea I'm day_1 time_1
I have 2 exams on day_2 should I sign up for it and get another exam changed?
And I have a test Day_2 at time_1
No
So I should keep what I got right
Yeah
Actually you still have 3 exam within 25 hours
but since you scheduled it yourself they'd probably just tell you to register for another slot
Yo can you make a post on FB asking if someone wants to take DI/PM as part of our split
Uh sure?
prices for each btw?
170, 100 DI gets SGR and Mat
I mean the DI people havent responded yet
So it could go
But I want this done fast lol
Kk I'll post when I'm back
If people want to lower the price just message me and ill do the math to see if its all good
why tho
why is it trashy?
ye
because its the ultimate compilation of remixes of female pop songs
idk if trashy is the right word but I love it nonetheless
Yeah, I think trashy might not be the word you're looking for
I'm listening to it rn tho

I love how ravey spice is a related song
i've come to the realization that at least for me the related songs are just my recently liked tracks
i'm mad he's hotter irl
(he looks more like person_463 irl)
person_237?
Are You Going To Kiss person_237 On The Cheek
yes
and no
dang it
he's already gone
and off to ithaca in the fall
Idk usually rob ford
*does
Idk who that is
person_238 rob person_239?
Ya
I thought he graduated
No I think he's doing masters
Or maybe co op?
Idk
Yeah I still thought he graduated already. He is technically my year
Ya I know
A bunch of last year's seniors are still here
Yeah like most of them
Ooh how's person_466?
I forgot about her
Haven't seen her this quarter
Too bad she's great
pic
for organization_88
Do you need a bio that's actually written out like a short description of myself or the bio that I sent you earlier was fine?
That other one is gucci
I'll adapt it if needed
kk
I mean, if you're having a mini-bio for the organization_88 website, I'd like to make one proper
mmkay do that then
kk
I'm using the other for our presentation at callput
By 1km, you mean 1000 blocks?
Yes
Wait...
No I meant 200 blocks
It's late at night i guess
I'm confused
Im moving it 200 blocks north
The radius of the circle is 100 blocks
Holy shit the first song is metal
This is literally like thrashgrind
With industrial interludes
person_240
I'm gonna be honest song 1 has me fucking hype
See I didn't like it as much
But my background in that style is weaker
So it makes sense
I'm not even sure if I can draw proper comparisons without involving like 3 or 4 other artists
Like Public Enemy collabing with some metal band collabing with Death Grips
That's okay genres are descriptions not hard labels
Or even some glitch/breakbeat artist
Ugh, I wish I didn't have to do homework and shit
I just want to give this a thorough listen
I think so
Probably later in the after noon
that sounds fine
I love you
I love you too
How are you?
sorry for recommending it :(
uninstall right away lol
Eek
Can you remind me again tonight?
i'm really surprised
yeah
they'd been /the/ go-to for a long time
Mhm
I miss you again
I want to kiss you again
I miss you too
I had a really good time at the zoo
so did I <3
:(
I cri
person_241
You're cryin' anyway. But on that note, what's gucci?
U right
I'm in class
B0ring.
I have physics recitation later, but I'm at work until then.
should i go  to comp apps
i want to ask person_451 question
If you skip I'm skipping
ughh i don't know
I'm already in the class
or should i go and then leave early?
It's a guest lecturer it's probably not important
okok
well then tell me what happened
Lol okay
but what if he does roll call or something like that :O
Why would he do that he never does that
but it's a guest lecturer
I think you're safe lol
Not a lot of people are here 
Okieeee lol 
=1
=1
Lol 
:O all the best!
God will be with you :)
Make sure you get enough sleep though, that's more helpful than last minute cramming!
eh hard la
haha I'm starting now pls
person_206
you leh? waiting for hair to dry ah?
How come now then starting!!
Yea haha so smart
I should invest in a hairdryer
Forgot to send pic
person_242, me person_401 and person_402 were cleaning up the living room and kitchen
We wanted to ask you if you have any furniture for living room by any chance?
Unfortunately no. I moved into my bf's straight from location_52. Didn't bring any furniture. I have been on the look out for it though. on the lafayette Buy and sell page
Okie np. We've few chairs and stuff , tried to make the living room look pretty
If you find any free futon (the metal one type ) on person_243, please feel free to share here and we'll run and get it haha
I dun think anyone of us wants to spend in furniture 😬
But we can try to get something for free haha.
Also, your room ac and my room ac have less air flow , that problem will be eventually fixed..
O.o
So yeah
<3
Ill have another package sent to your house just for you
o:
It starts with a b and ends with an omb
Itll say for Even on it
O: Is it a bod-omb t-shirt? person_137 you're so nice.
YES.
Yes and wear our purity vodka shirts
We cannot have both
100 over 24 hours isn't a lot right?
But ido regularly wear that shirt
And definitely not
Out?
If we sleep 8 hours that's like 6 a day
:(
i guess we wont be sleeping together then
How late r u gnna be up
like 1
Okie we probably won't sleep together tnight then :(
i wonder if i can sneak up into quad hehe
It's double dipped sooo ;)
we shall see
No. He is not a bear.
oh oops
He is cool guy though
bears have unheard voices in the race for senate tho
Haven't heard back from vosky since asking about where I will be
oh..
maybe he got off work right then
Yeah I'm not worried yet
yee
I mean if he asked that question I must at least have a chance right
yeah man
he would not ask if he was planning to not hire
you
that would be weird
like some poop who likes to lead on ppl for fun
That would be mean
and weird
This would be dream scenario for this summer though 
yeah i know
so cool
gosh
i think i'll actually have to stay here for the summer
so sad...........
Is concepts not going well?
i wanted to go attend my cousin's wedding :(
no..even if i passed it, it'll be better for me to finish both 150 and 213 during the summer
(impossible)
Yeah I don't think you should do that
Is your cousin's wedding during summer 1
yupp
Aw :(
sad
very sad
my parents want me to either graudate early
or graduate with a masters
which is essentially the same  thing
What if you graduate in 5 years with a masters
oh thanks for emailing wil
it'd be nice if he had oak park work for us
Yeah
No problem
Rip
too bad
Worth a shot
mhm
What were your thoughts on asking the oak park people how much they make
i'm in favor, but not strongly
I just don't want person_178 to get mad at us
that's true
i don't think he'd be mad if asking for a raise would be reasonable
he's probably paying us all the same amount, anyway
Mhm
Part of me worries he pays person_244 less
mhm
Idk
Hey person_245, sure, how much would you like to offer?
25$.
Okay.
I have one other offer at the original price.
Which is 28$?
Is that your final?
Yes
I can pay 28.
Did I text you first though :P
Okay. Yes you did. So you get first preference. When can you pick up? I'm close to east liberty.
Can you tell me the exact address?
Or the street name?

Oh hi
Oh damn I actually got a response from vosky manufacturing
I emailed them asking if they would have summer work available for me and the guy responded and said to email a resume.
Wawwww good job
That's the place right next to ge
That manufactures parts for them
Oh damn
Waw
I mean they'll probably look at my resume and be like nah but I'm happy I at least got a response
So pessimistic
Is your resume updated
I mean I have no reason to expect anything else
Yes it is but no one ever responds do it probably sucks
Maybe I'll ask advisor to take another look at it quickly
I should look at it
But I trust the career advisor
Ok
Girls in elevator think the trump chalks are real
I'm pretty sure they're a joke
I hope
Yeah its hard to tell which people actually support trump and who does it as a joke
Hey what's up?
just wanted to chekc an answer for one of the probability questions
4b --> standard deviation of cost of the project
That one I'm pretty sure I got wrong, but I have 420.886
did u 'turn in your ' pblms?
and get a score?
(i had 600k --> person_358 posted answers was ~459.6465) - so am a little confused
I turned it in and got 9/10, and I'm positive that that problem was the one I got wrong
yea
same
we're allowed multiple submissions so was a little unsure and wanted that 10/1 0 :-P
He did?
person_256 par
I couldn't find anything in my email atleasy
May be in person_257
I heard ini INI
not sure
I'll check when I reach home
You can join any years class btw
Sign up to previous spring and see
Should not be unethical I guess
ohk
Either way, I think the paper was pretty simple
Most people I know got 90 
hmm
cool
Yo
Just enjoy the final week or two :D
haha..yo :)
When are you coming here?
I'll be reaching on 7th
cool
wait did i put i was available?!
oh gosh
didn't mean to hit that button, but yes
it said 5/5
oh crap
we also don't all have to meet for all that time
im actually only free till 6
oh man im so sorry
np!
i'll still go till then though
and if you guys wanna meet slightly earlier im also fine with that
we're all free 1-6
and with any luck, i *might* be free some time next week, seeing how well our performance went last night
ok i'll confirm the time for this sat again?
need to check with my team
but, there's no availability for rooms until time_1
but, we could meet at the organization_54, since it's earlier hours
ahh ok
from 1-6
that works, though i'll have to leave at 545 to catch the last shuttle
same
can you check your availability and verify it's correct elsewhere?
yup!
looks good
i can run to your class
omg
it's gonna dieeee 9%
I don't have my charger on me lol
oh
nooooooooooooooooooooo
you'd have to take my ID and go to my room
which I can do
it's ok
if you really need it
well. I can just go home around time_1
or 7
and it should be safe enough
i have a meeting at 5
I can go to person_50 front door with my ID
you know where my room is right?
........
lol
it's a maze in there
yeah but I can't leave class
for that long
it's my biomed class
just buy a second charger omg
Same, I'm just trying to get past this semester at this point
I need the hard reset of summer before I can take physics 2
I can't wait till summer
Next week is the last week of school for me
Then it's finals week
I have 4 finals and 1 essay
Release me
I think I have 3 finals and a lab practical
Is that like a lab report?
It's kinda like a final except more hands on
like last semester we had to do circuits and whatnot
That seems like an interesting take on finals if nothing lese
else*
yeah, It's a good break from sit-down exams
I still have like a month left though which blows
ouch
I can see the light at the end of the tunnel
but the tunnel is littered with shit
so much learning left to do

Good morning
Guess who just woke up
I love you
How do you feel?
Sick
Aw 😞
I woke up at like 7 and took some decongestant and went back to sleep
how's madison?
It's good
We're sitting in a a garden
(y)
We ate a large thing of hot and spicy cheese bread
sounds delicious
It was.
Like 12" in diameter and 5-6" tall
that's a lot of bread
Yeah it was great
Oh my god my family is crazy
:/
I can't handle person_259
I'm sorry
I'm probably in trouble now
I just left from the dinner table
We were playing uno
Yeah
That's frustrating
Whatever
She's too much
if you join our world i made a lot of potions
Okay
i also made an underground room for growing giant mushrooms with bone meal
in the backyard, next to the cocoa
You should stay in pgh
Lie to your parents about having resesrch
And do naughty things with person_44
My mom has a contact at organization_56, I'm trying to get something there
That sounds Japanese 
They're in location_55 
They're actually a really big deal, they do a lot behind the scenes stuff when it comes to the internet
And we did naughty things last night 
;)
Were new levels reached
Yes
Details

Wtf now he's too attached
LOL

I wanted to know where do these guys generally stay
whether they stay in SF or they stay outside somewhere and do up down via organization_57
I know a friend who stays in location_56.. I think a friend of hers stays in SF, I'll just confirm and let you know
sure
thanks
I am currently planning to stay in location_57
costs are lesser
but the downside is travel time
about 50 mins one way via train
please let me know
Hmmm yeah, there's a trade off.. I've already asked.. I'll get back to you as soon as I hear back man
sure thanks a lot !

One of them was cute tho...
Intern buddy

His housewarming

Oh. I have test tomorrow though and I need sleep 
oh, well sleep
remember that women exist to civilize men
and that we did the world a kindness by inventing refrigerators for them
Well I would say we did do the world a kindness by inventing refrigerators
And by we I mean whoever invented them
I just find the idea that it was a gift specifically to women by men really funny
Yes I know
Here have the right to vote and some refrigerators

Yes

With me and person_129
But I want to organization_24 and chill with you <3

To the ones I knew
Nice
Also you were on the roof
Yeah. Good times. Kinda dangerous though.
Damn living on the edge
Interestingly enough, by default I'll be in the 10% of the graduating class by default based on program selection. They have three choices for the degree called program a, b, and c. A is a practicum aka internship (coop) that 90% of students choose. B is an independent study project which I'll probably do. And c is a thesis which I haven't ruled out.
nivce
Lame part is I got a lot of prerequisites to do having not had any formal comp Sci education.
really??
like what?
Well, comp Sci... But like <500lvl classes for Java, programming in general, etc.
And one stats class.
thats totally fine/fair
Good to learn that crap
Ya. Just means I'll be in location_53 longer :(
eh its fine
shit is TOO expensive in SF ne ways
u'll move to austin
live like a hipster
eat massive burritos
and own more space than u'd expect
mebe get a latina wife
That would be fine by me.
nah polska or bust for u
location_59 politics would probably make me want to stab someone tough
stab vs shoot -- haha thats all u gotta know in terms of politics and u'r views vs texas

Like it's all good but like twice it's normal price
smh
*its
Also mark hasn't responded to me, but would you mind leading exec tomorrow if he doesn't?
ya sure..... what do I have to do
Not much. Ask for people's updates and then discuss discussion items
okee
Also just try to make sure people do go on super long and irrelevant tangents
lmaoooo, does it actually say that in the article?! I didn't read it I just saw the title and forwarded it to you.
That's hilarious.
It actually says that
so great
I want to visit the gay penguin paradise
please lets. The happiest penguin paradise on earth.
It's in germany though
Heh, I'll visit it this summer and let you know how it goes.
Take lots of pictures
I'll bring a 64 gb sd card just for the occasion. I'll send you like 500 pictures of gay penguins being gay.
Ok I might be put on a list for that though
Worth it
Ok then
Om omw
Im
person_275's going to come back at 420 to shower 
DW I'm just gonna walk in and drop it off
And leave 
Gotta do something after
Oh okay
I'm in my downstairs dorm
ohh is it good?
It's called person_276
It's about constipation lol
whatt loll
how is that a movie
It's about an old man with constipation lol
It was actually a really big movie when it came out last year lol
ohhh lol was it a comedy?
I think it's supposed to be funny but offer some kind of social commentary 
Yes
10 minutes or so
oh awesome!
Now go do local taxes
Lol that's it na?
I mean sprintax and glacier
Is there any more?
Local
Wtf
You've done tax_1
Does sprint tax do local?
How to do local ?
I don't know man
Check your mails
You must have got a mail
snail-mail
with a bunch of forms for local taxes
Lemme know when you do that then :p
lol
location_60 looks pretty cool
Yeah I thought so too
Is that your preference?
Uhhh yeah. Have u been to niagra?
I havent been to either.
I have been to niagara
It's very cool, but very touristy
Lets go somewhere none of us have been before
I thought it was fine. It wasn't disorganized or anything and makes sense?
K, just wanted to make sure cuz when you write about stuff you're passionate about it doesn't always make sense
So I shouldn't cut out the descriptions of the characters?
Definitely. Like trying to fit a lot of info with the thing
Wait. In the intro or first few para?
Oh, those first few things are all part of the 'intro'
That's what I wanted you to look at, not just the first para
I think Patriots intro could be touched up because it's a little confusing. 
They were sexist is, I think too much of a blanket statement for person_277 and I don't know if their relationship is relevant unless it's explored later. 
Fair, especially because I cut the comment about how she hooks up with speed anytime something gets difficult
That. 
You have to be consistent with miss/ms america
Wiccan and hulking are *also* in a relationship. Not only, but also construction. 
I think the descriptions about their sexuality and stuff is fine though. 
Although maybe you can find a way for transitions to be smoother, like not just listing. 
person_1's too strong yo.................
is sensei really stronger than her
ys
yes
they fight in the webcomic
so this person_484 girl saw a step ladder
wtf
they do? tatsu vs sensei?
yes

what's wrong with a steplader
i dont know
the entire exchange confused me a lot

u do 2 much for me :'(
i feel so bad
LOL not really 
I was bored and didn't want to do work 
You live in schlag right
loool
dont take it to my dorm
i'll meet u halfway
Lol okay well I'm almost at schlag
I took the bus to mm cause I'm lazy
loool
best big <3
should i come down?
Yeah
pst, any idea what the wW wE wN and wS are for?
o.O
i thought it was fro mpage 36 in the textbook, but can't be sure
Wall north, wall south, etc. just identifying boundary conditions as no slip. I believe
The pg 36 stuff I believe we use as is in the book
okie
I think that's why he says the 2 is just a flag
lol after i type these equations in
i'm just gonna go to bed :3
:(
how was step 3?
i wouldn't think step 3 is too bad
It's fast, just the progressive eqns which are super short
which means, step 2 is probably the biggest bitch of them
yeah my thoughts too
Yeah, I think that must be where my issue still is, everything else is straightforward
zzz
okay
well thanks again fo yo halp
you the best
No problem!
You rushed?
Technically no?
My new member period is two weeks
Not two months
So no?
But yet
Yes
Congrats! 
Axo is solid 
Yeah everyone is very nice
who do you know in it?
person_286, person_287, person_288, and person_277 
person_286 and person_277 who?
person_289 and person_290
person_286 is a potential big I think
Also person_277 is MSE
person_286 is awesome!
She is insanely cool
We're getting bubble tea Wednesday
I'm excited to get to know her
This was like the 3rd or 4th all nighter we've pulled together
I think we've got something special going on here lol
;)
Usually she takes naps and I'm the one who wakes her up from her naps
I never realized how intimate waking someone up is lol
Yeaa
At least waking them up nicely lol
I can't vacuum her like we do person_291
nahhh just do it :P
There's no vacuum in the cluster
It is by far the most efficient method of waking someone up
do it with your mouth
I have been on the receiving end of the vacuum before it is very effective 
That's kissing person_165
Which, unless you do it while you're asleep, you can't do when they're asleep
*awake
just tell her it was to wake her up
I'm connected to the bus wifi c:

Dude all my classes are giving food today
I got donuts from one and cookies
I don't remember getting food last year in any of my classes
Plus we had 373 donuts yesterday 
omggg well i dont have class today lol
kinda disappointed that our client didnt give us anything tho
also 373 was 2 days ago
but for company_1 their clients have to pay to be a client and i think they're still told to get all their students gifts lol
Do you wanna go over concurrency and synchronization later

Oh lol
Ugh I hate being at my grandparents house
mhm
So my mom sent me a package
It had a lot of things I left at home, including one pair of shoes
I go to put these shoes on, and i notice that the left one is rattling
Smart mom, she packed a lot of small stuff in there!
So i look at the goodies in the shoe:
- a watch charger for a watch I no longer have
- a USB AC adaptor (!!)
- my small external battery (!!!!!)
And two condoms
That I completely forgot I had
thanks mom
I am screaming
Mother please
The funny thing is that I didn't actually end up needing them during the summer
Take them to ezoo
have some fun rave sex
Not even lying, there was an empty condom wrapper at the front of one of the stages one day
better than a full condom
That may have been in the vicinity, I might have just missed it
ew

So person_82 is afraid of person_294 being a thing lol
???????
They were never complete shit
They were always a rogue deck
They havent changed since you got victor lol
I mean since they won location_63 lol
hes apparently scared
But nothing has changed
location_63 guy won cause he was ballsy enough to play a T1.5-T2 deck
If enough people played person_294 it would top moe
*more
Cause its not a bad deck but it doesnt completely break the meta either
Id say that its as good as 7seas
I know nothing changed, hell im sad nothing changed (gimme gbt10). And you can say if more people played anything it would top more, it's like that's how meta works
Im just saying its as potent as 7seas
But people like hype
u seem to hold more than 50% shares in free n for sale
rofl
shopaholic 😬😬😬
i end up buying things i dont need
ha ha
and the skates and humidifier are eshan's :P

And person_489 doesn't like me either

and theres always historian hehe
I made it 21 moves before resigning
hahaha
was he nice?
Oh yeah, super friendly! I'll edit the videos together later today. I did very well, actually, for the first 10 moves, and I'm annoyed with myself for losing: not because he played better, which he absolutely did, but because I lost even sooner by making dumb mistakes. I was tired by the time of the game and got excited that I was doing well, and then suddenly I couldn't think my moves out at all, and it went right down hill from there.
Ok, perhaps super friendly is generous. He was nice and professional though, and gave good feedback.
That's super cool!!
Yup!
Anyway, I feel better about playing normal games now, because I've seen I /can/ do well if I just make thoughtful, natural moves.
131 now
gained 1 pound total
Lollll
I think I lost 3?...haven't weighed myself since like a few days ago though
DANG IT
i need to gorge myself
Have fun eating more~~
And lifting weights heh
Oh yeah? 4 hours straight or in total?
straight
not by myself though
Ah, probably a good thing 
You had fun though?
yeah
they weren
*weren't sunfish
What were they?
they had jibs and they needed some rigging
one was a capri, the other was an oday
Oh neat, that's pretty cool
the boatswain's father used to race semipro so he knew the ways so that was helpful
Oh huh, that's awesome
When did you get back today?
a bit before 9
we were originally planning to stay still day_1, but it was supposed to rain all day day_1, and breaking camp in the rain sucks
It's true, yeah, that's never fun
so we all opted just to come home tonight
Sounds like a good call on you guys' part
yeah i thought so
well i moved "professional experience" up above "extracurriculars"
what a step into adulthood
I love you
Still using mine as a template?
And I love you
:p
the left side is somewhat sloppy
You can put organization_61 under education :p
can I?
Yeah
wait actually I don't think I can
i would need to put down a start date, right?
You actually can lol
You're enrolled
aug 16 - present
er, august 22nd
which hasn't passed yet
You don't put a start date for NCP
oh you're right
just say "anticipated 2020"
that's how that works
Or something like that
person_252
where are you drinking
i'm skyping with my parents
Lol not the best time to be drinking 
So my situation is that I started drinking around 5:30 and then I had a quarter of a weed brownie and then I walked to an Indian restaurant on person_296 and then I walked to Five Guys and back to my suite (I don't remember any of that) and now I'm back in my suite where there's a lot of people drinking 
LOL
So if you come here there'll be a lot of people you don't know because there's a lot of people I don't really know
i'm not coming then
just gonna enjoy my dinner
Tbh I really don't want to be here either, I don't like drinking with people I don't know
mom: come say hi to the neighbor. me: no I don't have a bra on. mom: they have a new puppy. me: 🏃🏃🏃

Hmm lemme ask

LOL

very different summer i think

qqqq
I always have person_298
but

chewable
allergy pills
Oh

Cuz I don't have those lok
Also entropy?

if u can just bring me 1 or 2 :)
<N
It's all 150
Which DPolice
D robo
Awe no gallop?
I hated it, so I got rid of Gallop.deck, but if youre asking about the stride yeah it has 4
Damn I love gallop lol haha I already have the g unit gallop was just missing G3
My problem was that it couldnt finish
Oooooh
So 150 is the trade value or sell value?
150 sell
Whats the trade value?
Same lol
Is trade value organization_19 market price? Or organization_19 low?
Tcg low
Hmmm
The sun sets so late, during the afternoon I feel like i have way more time than i actually have
no i hate how it sets so early in the winter
 well this is the very first time in my life I've felt this way
how dare you
Usually I love it too
But this fucked up schedule got me fucked up
I really FUCKING hate this semester bc of this FUCKING schedule
And fucking keeps on autocorrecting to caps
so angry :C
Bc I slowly feel like I'm dying
I mean we are slowly dying everyday
If I get 8 or 9 ams next year I'm quitting school
oh ok
join national park service
protect bears
Yes
actually sounds like a pretty nice job if you are outdoorsy
not well paying
but fun and rewarding
and you will be helping cute foxes too
did you like seeing pics of my dinner
Ok game over we'll be home in probs 25
I dawdled a little long and fixed a thing, and then realized I forgot your thing in the sink
Lol
So that's in my backpack and I'm leaving now
Oh okay
Cool
Cool, thank you
mom is going to ship it off tomorrow
Cool thank you so much
Have you had a chance to listen to Radiohead?
i listened to the first couple, but it took me almost the whole bus ride to get it working on my phone
Aw shame
Did you hear decks dark? One of my favorites 
im not sure
which one was that?
It's the third song
Really gorgeous piano at the beginning
maybe, i don't really remember, i was in the car talking to mom
Ah, gotcha
Give it a listen on your speaker system
You won't be disappointed
sounds good
or at least i hope it will
I think you'll like it
Like I said, it's a little slower, but it's really pretty
i don't have a problem with that
God it's just so nice to have new organization_45 in my life
And it's not bad
and some passed away grabbers
Ohhhh
Yeah, since that's the one thing I need more than anything else from the new set
I thought this set was bad
It's not the best set, but it's better than like, Cyberdark Impact or Shadow Specters
Lol
Profit wise this set is ass unless you like pull multiple Cyber Angels/their support, Cipher Dragon, and then the Timaeus shit
YGO man...
YGO is super jank
Then you look at The Dark Illusion and if you pull Desires you profit there and then.
But if you dont isnt it straight neg
Uh it's only straight neg if you pull The Forceful Checkpoint
Is the coral dragon break even?
Coral Dragon, Nirvana, Cosmic Cyclone, and The Hidden City you can break even. The organization_62 stuff you can also plus off of
Not a bad set, could crash tho no?
I mean any set can crash, plus considering the SE of this set is location_66 exclusive that kinda hurts
Ohhh, I mean CFV seems to be ridiculously stable
Ok so how do I die
I put all my stuff in a chest on a beach
lol
And wrote down my coordinates
fall off something high?
suffocate in water
Can I drown?
yes
this is so morbid
Let's go
lol
I'm scared
This is a slow way to die
One heart
so is ironing pants
(y)
Lol I was at coordinates_1 and my house is at coordinates_2
:p
i love you
and I love you
how are you?
okay
v reluctantly spent $8 on a sandwich
because I didn't have time last night to pack a lunch and person_490 delayed in the bathroom and made me late
ugh
thats kinda the worst
yeah
annoying
oh well

hey, did you assign the rest of the articles?
there are no names in the spreadsheet for them

Got up late?
I woke up late, and watched the bus go past when I headed out this morning, so I had to run.
To what meeting
And did you wake up late because I kept you up...? :c
No.
For some short part time thing.
Hopefully I do not need it.
Because it is not really a part time thing even.
What was it? And are you sure I didn't keep you up?
Totally in location_13. 
Essentially assistant to a graduate project experiment.
Meaning?
As in, they do the experiment, I stand by the emergency shut off swith.
*switch*
Oh. Do you get paid. And what kind of experiment?
Yeah. They are working on collision detection for manufacturing. So the robot arm should stop when something is in the way.
The issue is it is about 40 hours total.
So it is not even a part time summer thing.
And it is person_302 over here.
Shhhhhh we pretend. 
I could spin it one way or another. It is not research.
I see. And also not technically your friend. So why a meeting?
I need to stop playing minecraft and go to bed
:p
I bet
I finished my thing
I'm still finishing this server work
I'll show you Monday
Ooh
I'm v proud
and slightly ashamed

I miss you
I miss you
You were horny this am

You're very attractive
I could say the same
Have you eaten
Yea

I'm no where near location_70
Oh shit
It's a three day weekend I'm going to get away from location_70 for the weekend
Ohhh
People are really very very intelligent..it's tough to compete with these ppl
Life is hectic no sleep nothing
Same here
person_303
People are serious about studies
And the college expects the same
A big jump😳
And more than that the effort they put is less and o/p is more
Haa bahut difference aa gaya hai...I am struggling
Same here
Hope successfully 2 years nikle with a degree in hand

Hey person_304..how are you?

Yeah sure :-)

person_305
Same here
Ok but did it seem a little easy to you
I like answered everything
But I don't think some of my answers were right
Like
The fuckig stream tree thing
I thought the set part was easy
I'm honestly not sure
Good news is we will know tonight
Wait what
How
They're grading it today apparently
What the fuck
Holy shit
It's a 300 person class
Ya
No idea
But that's what they said
That's fucking crazy, wow 
Oh my god dude
I just wanna know already
Oh I see
Does it matter that much? 
What mistake did you make 
it matters
a lot
like when i was drawing a wall
i am supposed to use a thiner line for the windows
Oh

Hey
I'll edit them soon!!
Hello c: 
Should I eat them on my phone
Also I need to call mom
Cause my allergies r getting really bad
person_306
Yes
Wat haha
Come back and take meds
Oh
Edit*****
Lol
And ya I will in a bit
But yeah sure c:
Edit them
But I don't think I have allergy medicine
The thing I took was only for nasal
I thought you did
There's allergy meds sold at entropy
Hopeful they aren't sold out
Lemme ask mum if I have any
person_307
Didn't make any progress in comp apps
Thats fine
I can't find a O(logn) solution
actually
you shouldn't do that
Yeah I realized that
cos i don't think person_480 or person_481 will understand
or can explain that lol
It's not possible to find a O(logn) solution
even if you can find one
Because n = infinity
but i also don't think it's possible to find O(logn)
cos it's not really binary search
yaa
Yeah because it's an interval on the reals
I think they do big O in 110
Ohh but its still hard to explain it lol
I could write that part
I'm probably going to end up writing some of this anyway
I guess I'll just go with person_308's solution then, although I don't know the big O of findpeaks()
U coming today
Got a short paper to write then organization_64 hmwk but I'm hoping to
Lol 115
Connect person_164
Not when you haven't been to the last 3 lectures and have barely finished you prelabs on time
I never went to lectures
Got an A
Class was ezpz
Kk big shot. I'll be there as soon as I can
for dinner had cong you bing, soup dumplings, minced meat noodle, fish, sticky rice dumpling
bought some bread buns for breakfast
What did you cal me
mom brought me spinach and tofu
tofu of all types
i didn't call you anything
Called me a bing
bing is good
oh no why
Lol beautiful
what are you doing tomororw
Going to ny
going to the land of pretty the room
What
so Ive been testing it and was having all sorts of problems because they didn't give me access until last day_1. but i did a few renders and its working great for me now.
so if its not working for you (which you should be in the list i believe) you might have to track down the person who can put you in the list (i think its on a per user basis)
everyone here at organization_65 is supposed to have it for houdini as well but for some reason only person_309 and I have it and no one else has access for some reason
Interesting. I haven't even touched it, didn't have much of a reason to. Was more efficient chain rendering out of person_310 last semester, and will likely use Vray in 2017 this semester
I did some freelance person_222 over the summer and used cloud rendering from GridMarkets, don't know if I'll ever need the farm tbh
okay awesome. i haven't used much houdini recently but the rendering time was always the biggest problem
Yeah, the rendering in mantra takes a bit of time. 15.5 included support for outside renderers, might be worth your while to checkout octane v3
okay I will. also I talked to person_400 yesterday and said you guys were doing some potential architecture real-time stuff. I think i read somewhere that they recently made a vray plugin for unity so you might check on that
thanks for the tip. that's mostly just person_400 haha I'm doing environment design in unreal but his thesis is on archviz so I'll pass it on
how are things at the ec?
okay awesome, env design using what? Im curious
ue4, unreal engine 4
well a pipe in the union burst causing our CAVE to flood so fun times are ahead :D
oh right you said that haha
whoah! sorry to hear that
very cool man, UE4 can make things look sexy as hell in real time
you're doing masters this year, right? 360 vid?
yeah, loving ue4 for speed/turnout of assets
i'm still a newbie at it, but i've gotten decent at texturing
its an area of interest still definitey but I want to focus more on programming/VR applications for the masters
I understand. VR has so many interesting areas to explore
btw what time on the 15 can i go over? i need to book my tickets to nyc (:
thanks!
well ill be moving out so it might be a bit messy but you can come over anytime after like time_1?
ok!
i'll probably take the overnight bus and go over at 9am then
thanks (:
sure no problem!
and person_443 still hasn't replied but I'll give you the guy person_311's context once I get it
sure no worries (:
Babe person_121
I'm home but TBH I'll look at your thing tmro
Hi
I love you
I finished assembly but idk if it'll be strong
I made it looser this time
gonna load it up I think
i read that solder joints display more shear force with a faster applied impact
er, shear strength
which means that a long-term pull is exactly the worst thing I could do with it
oh well
You'll be done soon?
Wanna call me?
Why do I feel icky after this statement?
because its really problematic
and basically saying that its not an issue
Explain...? Like it feels wrong. I can't pinpoint how 
its saying that people are making too big of a deal out of the fact that she's a women
I mean. Isn't that true? Like yes and no. No I will not vote for her just because she is a woman. I will look at her policies. 
It's like. Partly true,  no?
but he's implying that people are only voting for her/supporting her because she's a women
its implying that people aren't already voting by their best intentions
Is it? I really cannot tell what is bothering ne
Me (
*
it can be
Like, i feel like he said something sexist. 
in the subtext, it is
Hm... I mean, there has been talk about his implied sexism in his speeches. 
Why?
I like boy
a lot
I still haven't kissed him, I might have tried a pass today but he was sick this weekend but still coughing today
Hahaha ok ><
How long were u planning on staying at location_71?
honestly Lord willing
I would love to stay here for the rest of my life LOL
as long as God wants me here
cuz I absolutely love this company and what it stands for
and the company culture, etc.
unless something really drastic happens
I would absolutely love to stay at location_71
Oh really? 😯 I'm glad u found a place u really like! ^^
yes, and I actually would love stay in location_3 as long as God wants me here too
which is crazy, I didn't think I would be thinking this when I started back in month_1
Oh really? Did u think u'd look for another job?
mmm honestly not really
I knew that person_312 would be the place to be
it's just that I wasn't completely sure if I wanted to stay in location_3
because part of me wants to go to location_72, location_73
part of me wants to go to location_6
at least, back when I started
now...I honestly wanna stay in location_3 as long as God wants me here as I said lol
I think the reason I feel this way is largely because of the new opportunity to switch from consulting to the department_1
and also because of how awesome my church here in location_3 has been
oh how much time do u have?..
would u mind me interviewing u? lol
I have till time_1 ish
oh ok hmm idk if we'll have enough time for the interview but let's see how long dinner takes? cause the interview is only about 20min
and we could do the interview in the hci building - we'll have to use ur ID if u don't mind cause person_13's borrowing mine to get into 303
Ok! We'll figure it out 😊 will I have acces to the hci building with my ID?
ya all of us should :D
I mean the building where they teach dhcs
Ah ok ok 👍🏼
Hmm maybe. For 3c I just said the sum vector was from Neuron N because m was 0, right?
I think so, yeah
which just gives us a direction of right, correct?
Yea
That's really all I had for that part
alright, makes sense
have you been able to make any sense of this last essay thing though?
we'd probably just need to add the two neurons' probabilities to do bayesian inference, I imagine
I was thinking of using bayes theorem for one neuron and using that for the given in the bayes theorem calculation for the second neuron
She's been great
person_313 described her as aggressively affectionate this morning lolol
omg i wish she was like that with me
She thinks it's because I left and was like OMG I NEED COMPANY
She was like
Kt has been a real bitch about her
Like is either ignoring her or doing things to her that she doesn't like
I'm so over it
I cannot wait for graduation. I need to get away from her
she is such a biiiiiiitch
i hope she ends up alone in life
with nothing but her tv shows and soda
HAHAHA
she has no right to torment your cat
that is cruel
I know
like ignoring her is one thing, but bothering her is another
Oh dude
Hahahahaha
So close!!
What're you doing in miaoli lol
I'm going to hsinchu for the afternoon/night!
Haha I 烤肉ed in miaoli yesterday

Especially since i use my phone to play music a lot haha
You gonna get one?
What do you mean *the*
I found some in the study during one of the big cleans
Moved them to my white shelf so the didn't get wrecked
But did we just share one?
Well I just mean like where are the majority of them
My bad on wording lols
Oh, you buy them and keep them I believe
Oh no way
I had no idea
They are pretty cheap anyway
People are asking me about them
Like $20-30
And person_316 wants to wear a pair
Ask person_470 maybe?
Yea
Jesus christ that was a twenty-minute bus ride
Wait
Not ride
Would you tell your grandparents I'll be late? This is absurd
How far out are you?
Maps says 15m, I say 25 or so
Not yet at location_9
Oh really?
I'm kinda pissed
What time did you leave?
This bus is supposed to be every 10m, not every 20/nLeft the house at :39, bus just at 2:13

Hey
Who's the kid with the strangest name you've ever met?
Like someone I personally know? 
Or do famous people count
Someone you know
You know mine right
Ocean
yea
roflmao
that kid
He and person_320 are such a riot
Yeah I don't understand
Don't understand what?
Ocean
What dont u understand
oh that's too bad
Me neither
I love you too
So idk
My mom made another comment about us being too canoodley and then muttered something about how she doesn't like how you "paw me" or something of the sort
I love you
i'd rather not get epipen experience though
Oh one thing
I don't think it's too much but that's me
So maybe we should tone it down just a bit
Yikes
I think it would be better to just hold hands or something
I thought we were being p minimal
No spooning, maybe an am behind the other's back
I Just wanted a spot on the corner
Added bonus having you behind me
:p
Sorry <3
But I think you're right
I really didn't think we were that bad
Neither did I but idk
I like being w you
Mhm
person_419!!!
need to beg a favor of you guys
uh-oh
would it be possible to swap your mon rpis slot with our slot on another day?
ok wait we dont have a slot on another day
cos we have a playtest at 5, and person_420 refuses to let us have the 530-6 slot
and our actors are only free at that time
and they told us really late so by the time we wanted to book, person_420 had alr taken it
person_420 says if they will give us their slot if they can get one of yours T.T
You'd have to ask person_321, I don't have any authority over that.
ok ):
Sorry.
no worries
thanks anyw!
Feel free to ask her, though
yup ive asked person_421 to msg her
cool
good luck
thanks!
yo who was your internship mentor at organization_56
She left.
Oh damn you were that bad
She moved onto better things I guess
Did you ask her where she was moving
And she said on to better things
I looked her up on LinkedIn
Man 10 bands, 20 bands, 100 bands
Fuck it man, let's just not even discuss it man, omg
Only when I win I don't complian
Well we lost the hardware
We should've swept the men's events but we didnt
thats all your fault
Our plan was to sweep men's and win at least one women's event including mixed but we lost all women's and one mixed so now this last mixed doesn't even count
oh
Omg the suitegirls actually cleaned the bathroom
They washed my shower mat
good
I bought it in purple just for you
lol i think person_387 blocked me
Lmao what
south korean player got base hit
Waw
idk why she would blockme
very immature way to handle it
Didn't you only ask one question about why she threw up?
that was it
bathroom is correct place to throw up
just not the shower
Lol
Yeah Idk why she blocked you
cant own up to her mistakes
They were laughing about it tho
:(
i'm sure you'll do fine though
i sure hope so haha
on a separate note, if you're free tmr 7pm, im having another playtest at etc
if you cant make it its ok lol dont need to feel bad about it
haha I don't think so
have meeting then
and then more work!
haha ok
no harm trying to ask :P
this work is never ending sigh
haha yeah
post in ssa group la
aww dont sound so jaded
OH YA
GOOD IDEA
then again, posting in the group and asking people to come to etc usually doesnt work haha but ok i'll ask
Oh wait soooo there's a new Ramen place in shadyside :3 I think it's near walnut st..
Would u wanna try there??
lol sure! as long as we make it back before 8 xD
Oh jk jk I just found reviews for the place I first talked about :P
organization_66 said the Ramen is probably one of the best in pgh
OOOOOOOO
okay lol so location_1 at time_1?
Yessss
:D okieee
Should I stay an extra semester to get masters degree
waw you can get master's that fast?
If I take some extra classes senior year yes
waw
I don't have to make any decisions now but it's something to consider
yeah that's cool
advanced degree so fast
Senior year without it would be very light
But with it would be pretty heavy
light and dark
two sides
Something like that
lol
will can become a master
I guess you could say that
SCREAMS OUT LOUD
send this to person_471 and ask if he's into it
I'm screaming they're so much
l m a o
they're so
shaped
not shaped but like
they are a Shape
They are Defined and Frightening
Nah. I took an hour nap. And yeah. I just woke up.
nice
one hour?
I slept ar time_1 and alarm was time_2
omg
rip
when did you go back to sleep
Like 7.
so you got another 5 hours
YUP. Smh. Idk. I should've just watch the movie. Oh well. What are you up to? Did you even sleep?
how was your april 20th
uneventful
same
though i might be about to celebrate april 20st
21st*
hahahaha
teachers are dicks
i have two presentations tomorrow
Yeah I have mad work to do
But me and person_299 typically have our weekly smoke sesh's Tuesday and we missed yesterday
So gotta make up
Do you have the 255 book by chance?
I have a pdf of it
Can you send it to me?
Ok just give me a non organization_5 email
person_365@gmail.com
Are you taking 301 rn?
Yeah I am
When do you have it?
/who is your prof
time_1 name_1
Do you guys also have the 301 Olympics thing?
What?
Nope
We do
Its like a competition thing
We can get 9% extra credit if we do well
ugh they posted the extra credit assignment for 331 today
it's due monday
That's soon
these are supposed to be weekly asignments
i hate that they don't post them on time
I suppose it's organization_65
every week they've given us shorter notice
i gues
s
Is it hard?
maybe
probably not actually
Wait is it not exactly a dict?
i'm not sure how dicts work
it does the same thing as a dict
like to the user
but it might be different
it's probably the same, or v similar
ok so I have a 281/300 in the class
which is a 93
so i'll do the organization_65
idk how i did on the final
Probably smart
Please I need a ticket
I asked earlier and you said you were out
.
hey
yeah I'm not letting my parents go
so I've got another couple tix
I've been asking for $60 each
Umm is $20 okay
sorryy
Because that's how much you sold the last one
I know but that one was returned
Now I'm selling for higher bc it's closer to graduation
person_322, that price is way too high
I doubt anyone is going to pay a ticket for $60. Alright thanks anyway. Pretty sure I can get cheaper from someone else.
Good luck!
Yes
There are patches of it that I don't remember because of weed lol
?.?
Really lol
I LOVE U
person_202 and person_323 brought me to the tamarind and I somehow walked to 5 Guys and back to person_129's room and I only remember little snippets of the whole trip
Oo bebe
Hopefully you didn't suck any dicks on the way
No but I'm pretty sure I ran across Fifth
Because I saw someone else run across Fifth
So I did too
But what if my mom died
I can't do foster care
Dad will take care of you
Okay. Sorry. My laptop just broke and I am freaking out. 
shit, what happened?
I think the screen got disconnected from the rest of it
but you should still be able to get the data out of it
Yes
I need it now though for final papers
And I think it'll cost money to fix. 
And I just can't deal with this right now. 
can you get the stuff off an work on aschool computer for now
Oh shit I missed dinner block
yeaa
Yeah go ahead, and if you want something on your late block I'll bring it when I come over
I'm done packing, I'm just throwing stuff away and then I'll come over
are you not eating?
Oh okay I'll use your late block then lol
or do you want grubhub
what do you want to eat
I don't know
Just get me whatever you're getting
or do you want to go to subway when you come over later
Two feets
Yes it says two feets
Finished my two exams for today
Hello Mr. person_324,/n/nI am writing to follow up and inquire on the status of my application. I am very interested in working at organization_67 to get relevant hands on experience and improve upon my technical skills. I believe I would be a great fit for your company. Let me know if there is anything else I can do to further my application. Thank you./n/nSincerely, /nperson_492
hows that
Perfect

Wtf

I'm wondering if you should ask if there's a date that he'll let you know by
But I think it sounds top pushy
yeah it would be
plus i already sent it
Too
must be very polite in follow up emails
What does person_362 do tonight

I could tell him to come with me though
In july im just visiting

Ohh sweet
I mean we're there until l8 AF
So you can come w/e
true. i just dont know if I'm gonn ahve the motivation after my calc exam
161?
165?
161
Shouldn't be too bad, but gl yo
Yea i'm confident I know it. I just don't wanna panic right before
I got 3 exams next week and 2 hwks all on MTW
Fml yo
ewww have fun
It should be okay
Just time consuming
Its 27 bucks
Mayyybe it's a little high but I will if everyone else wants to. What's the entry for Regionals?
We might be able to just make it
Print the design lol
I asked person_35 to check since it was his idea
If someone has a screen printer, I could probably reconstruct the design
organization_5 has one I think lol
link_18
This is it
Or at least one of them
There were a few different ones lol
Mine is saying those are $40
Yeah the 27$ was a different design
Ohhh
the url http://clothing.cusbootsearch-2016.net/ca/States/14849/hwang-an-endless-legend-dragon-last-name-surname-t-shirt-black-hoodie-52RIJ7.html
That was this
Idk which one you like better
Cause colors might matter if we decide to print it
I'm building it on custom ink roughly to price it out
Kk
k it's back to its regular corrupted self
Well
I guess that's better than totally gown
Gone
the nether appears normal
hard to tell though
i was looking around in creative mode for missing spots and it's definitely way faster than the netbook
That's good
This is frustrating thin
Tho
Yeah
Like it won't take a long time to rebuild the farm and glass and stuff
but i don't remember everything in those chests
it's really annoying
We can guess
mhm
i'll make a sheet in a few mins
Let's do that tmro
ok
I'll bring my computer
ok <3

It should be track man
It is cross listed with a track
he is saying organization_68 in Spring at SV is track
person_332 is the one for mobility you talk to him
cos that is 14841
and this is 15821 so this is not track
Really?
you won't be here in Spring SV right?
are this is on google group..person_332 not replying..only person_333 and person_334
yeah i want to finish in 16
That moment when I say price negotiable and they say, sorry price too high
Like... wat
I swear to God people just enjoy trolling
Also why does no one want Pale moon wtf
I've gotten several messages about person_335
Idk I didn't think the stuff this set was that bad
I'm gonna have a drop the price hard for this one and eat the loss
I think I set RP and GP too low

No it's really slow
Ahhh ><

I mean it's not a super pressing matter to move things lol but hopefully it won't take that long..
ahh I want food rn hahahha
I might just make something now and eat the pork tomorrow :P
so i can't seem to get wireless working on that laptop
Hm
would you be able to leave it somewhere with an ethernet cable?  maybe like by the media stuff downstairs?
Um yeah probably. I can ask my dad tmro
cool
if not i can probably get wifi working
i think it's a combination of iffy drivers and cut antenna cables
Ah
Well our internet is 5-6x faster on Ethernet
So we might as well do that
that would help a lot, for a server
<3
it shouldn't be that big since i'll take the screen off once it's set up
Yeah it can probs go in that stack
cool
person_337!  I have a favor to ask you
What's up?
at some point next week or the week after, if we use my print quota, would you be able to print me out a nice photo sized for a picture frame?
Um I don't have access to a nice printer
But I can crop it?
Ask treat! He's got good printing
perfect!  I'll ask him
thanks :)
person_426???
I didn't know person_426 is friendly with you
He didn't say anything once I ignored his yo lol
We were in the same group in intro

Or tienmu
Age of the folks
Ah lol
Makes sense
mmhm
it was fun(ny)
b/c it was just super dorky fob people
one of the ousemates who lived their djs parttime and head agood set up going
and no one was using it
so me and this girl (my classmate) started pushing people to the floor
so --- yea as elderly statesmen --- it was entertaining to be like... bitch - listen/ do this
Lol
funniest stuff was the reaction of several girls
who were like... whoa u guys aren't nerds
Lol
Are you a  nerd I wonder
I'm definitely a nerd
Lol
So they weren't surprised at you lol
Hmmm?
The girls
listen

no visa
ohh now

but if you leave after you get your confirmation_1(visa_1) then you have to reenter with visa_1 visa
haha cannot la

booooo
haha
wahhhh
sorryyyyy
school is hard
nahh its fine (:
haha i know
my project is going better than expected haha after the showcase on wed the faculty are pretty excited about it!
like our advisors say we should turn it into a pitch project
and we were like but next spring im gone, so if we do it has to be next sem but the pitch deadlines are over alr!
and they were like hmm maybe we'll do a faculty pitch for you guys instead, then also can get funding from twitch
:D
Well nats...
Meh
And next year
GC is hank
*jank
Nah by then
New decks will come out
Or GC will get even more support...
Well duh
It's mc it's just the best deck
They've been decently big for a while
But the title makes it really seem that
Well, they are playing at location_75
I know
That is right near me

Like yearsssss back
I wnat to say sophomore year?
I'm still not sure
same
Oh my God it's so good 
I'm honestly really surprised
I haven't played the multi yet but the campaign is great 
I figured it'd be OK but not great
But that's awesome to hear
I hope it's not nostalgia goggles but I genuinely feel like I'm having fun 
I read that a lot of people are really enjoying it
I might Redbox that instead of uncharted tbh
Probably shorter
Probably but there's a lot of exploration and unlockable harder modes 
Hahaha hahaha cheap vodka especially !!!
I die
we tried some 100 ntd cherry vodka from chinese name_1 before, the image portrays exactly how it felt like LOL
Oh ewwwww
I bet
worst part was, it was warm vodka
i bought some apple juice to wash the taste down lol
Oh my god even worse lol
At least it was cheap and did the trick haha
I'm a super cheap drunk so yay my wallet is happy hahaha
yep, definitely was not pretty
LOL
budget alcohol , is pretty win-win
gets the job done, plus your wallet stays healthy
O.o
So she's OK?
What happened to her anyw did the doc say?
Good morning person_384
Yea
She's ok
Went hospital
Haha morning!
Blood pressure return to normal
Then they let her back
I think now she's on tour with the school to tour around location_52
Talk to you and my sis reminds me of when I was on exchange
Haha
So fun

No I don't want to
FINE
Sorry
I'll pie you for person_338's entertainment
i'll pie you for my own entertainment
yoo
The average on Exam_1 was unfortunately a score_1. Combined with the low average on exam_2 the current grade cutoffs for the semester are roughly:/n/n83 - A/n73 - B/n63 - C/n53 - D
I have hope!
For concepts?
ypp
Hooray! 
i'll get a score_2
lol
I actually got much better in exam 3
than my previous exams
So higher than a 56?
yup

lol
pizza
is there any other good eatstreet places?
i have the coupon

arent they in college park now?
we recently used a similar thing called order up to get paninis with a $10 coupon
no i mean in pittsburgh
when i come
oh
there are plenty of restaurants
we can check them out when you come up
ok bc the coupon is under your name
oh lol
What is the coupon for?
And what time are you going home this weekend?
time_1
oh oops
it expired already
No clue. Still in training phase
Yeah well these notifications are annoying
I had them blocked for a while
But then I guess that would defeat the purpose of the app
Haha yeah
Oh and did the hadoop thing
I made sure that all messages to to the same reducer
By giving all of the messages the same key
Ok same key?
Yeah
This whole thing defeats map reduce purpose
Yeah exactly
person_339, anything you can recommend to do in new york? person_146 and I are gonna do some museums this week and we bummed around the shops today, but figured I'd ask for suggestions
location_76 place_1, location_1 botanic gardens are both great
I think there's free kayaking either in park_1 or the location_1 at location_94
Oh yo really
Do you just have to rent one?
Or is it like completely free
I think, never been myself but i hear it's there
Nice, that sounds dope
Not sure, but i think if you look it up info is online
Aight, I'll give it a look
We made the mistake of going to times square
Got harassed by a fucking minion
Also the roosevelt island airtram is cool, i showed you guys that last time you were in but i doubt person_368s seen it
person_340
Yeah dude was kind of fucked
But yeah, that would be cool
Ah shit, looks like the kayaking season doesn't start until the 21st
Season 2 of battlebots is out apparentlt
i know
tbh i dont want to watch
my mom had them taped
Lol
sorry :p
It's ok :p
We have other things to do

Thinking about if I should get more to eat
Probably
I only had two thin pork chops
And I'd been a little shaky earlier
person_348

Sh
Sorry

Next time
Smart. So whats new in your life?
Just the usual Ebony things, you?
Usual person_442 things and super nerdy things.
Those aren't equivalent?
Was waiting to see if you thought that lol
I thought you obviously wanted me to say that
Eh, more intrigued on what you'd say

A banner?
For competitions?
Oh no

Then someone's going to make a drinking game where they take a shot when they see us
lol sounds good
you should be honored that you are the subject of a drinking game lol
Yes you should take a shot every time you see me lol
nope
Lol why not
You see me too much?
i'll probably be hungover every single day lol
day_1: friend and I are arriving. Hitting the strip bars. Fav bars are: bar_1,bar_2, bar_3, bar_4 in location_77, and the organization_70. Not limited to those, just the musts.

>read one of the 6 books for this childrens/adolescent literature and psych exam
>bullshit my way through the entire second half of the exam
>know none of the specifics when they ask for specifics
>106%

Sometimes i wished i majored in this shit just for my gpa
Holy shit, good show
Yeah, for real, I have yet to score under an A on all my non-subject_1 classes
All my ass busting in orgo got me a score_2
If i hadn't missed the final for my one gen ed I'd be in the same boat
Still pooper pained about that
I wouldn't count that, you would've scored plenty well on that exam
Yeah I'm sure, just hurts as a concept
I feel you
No idea what I'm getting in my course_1 especially after the anal that was the final but I'm hoping like at least a B- or a B
